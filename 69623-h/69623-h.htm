  <h2 class='c015'>PART THE SECOND.</h2>
</div>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_1'>1</span>
  <h3 class='c016'><i>Elizabeth, Countess of Torrenburg, to Count Oswald of March.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c017'>With this letter, my dear brother, you
will receive a part of the manuscripts,
which I engaged to send you: these leaves
contain the memoirs of the unfortunate
Urania Venosta, which have interested
me greatly from a variety of reasons.
I had erroneously supposed that the
MS. was complete, but it proves to be
nothing more than a fragment. Perhaps
I imprudently included the second
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>part of her adventures in the number
of those papers, which I was compelled
to restore to the Abbess’s custody; but
I am rather more inclined to believe,
that Time has destroyed the remainder
of these memoirs, whose conclusion I am
so desirous of perusing.</p>

<p class='c018'>It’s true, I have found a few more detached
leaves, and the last page or two;
but these only serve to augment a curiosity,
which would have remained totally
unsatisfied, if I had suffered the labour of
examining the moth-eaten parchments to
overcome my perseverance. I have now
no reason to regret the trouble which I
gave myself, since I owe to it the possession
of several other manuscripts,
relating to persons and circumstances
already mentioned by Urania. The memoirs
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>of Minna of Homburg and of
Lucretia Malaspina are both lost; but I
have found much respecting the two
Ladies of Sargans, to whom Urania’s
narrative is addrest; much too respecting
the noble and ill-fated Adelaide; as also
several letters written by the latter, one
of which seems to supply tolerably well
the chasm in Urania’s memoirs. As soon
as I succeed in decyphering them (which,
thanks to the dust and the moths, is no
easy task) I will not fail to impart to
you their contents.</p>

<p class='c018'>You will ask me, what impression the
perusal of this history has made on my
heart. Ah! my dear brother, it is but
too certain, that the unfortunate are
apt to find their own resemblance
every where! At first, how little similar
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>do the fortunes of Urania and myself
appear! and yet how easily might it
have happened, that we should have both
been sisters united in the same misfortune!
Might not Henry of Montfort,
(whose loss has cost me so many tears,)
in spite of his fair exterior, have proved
at heart as great a monster, as Ethelbert
of Carlsheim proved in spite of <i>his</i>?
May not the prayers, with which I solicited
Heaven to grant me Henry’s
hand, have pleaded for that, whose possession
would have proved to me the
bitterest curse of Heaven?</p>

<p class='c018'>Eternal Providence! never more will
I murmur that you denied me a request,
whose consequences were known to you
far better than to myself. I besought
you to bestow on me a blessing; you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>granted it by withholding that, which if
conferred on me would perhaps have
made me miserable for ever.</p>
<div class='pbb'>
 <hr class='pb c006' />
</div>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>
  <h3 class='c016'><i>Adelaide of the Beacon-Tower to Urania Venosta.</i></h3>
</div>
<p class='c017'>Oh! tell me, unhappy wife of my
unhappy father; you, whom I would so
gladly call my mother, had not she to
whom Nature bade me give that valued
name, compelled me to blend with it no
ideas but those of pain and terror; you,
whom I already love, and whose future
affection I wish so anxiously to obtain;
oh! tell me, Urania, was it but a dream, or
have I indeed found at length the friend
and sister whom I sought so long in
vain, and whose counsels and whose
comfort my tortured heart needs so
greatly?</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>Yet alas! what avails it that we have
met? Already are we separated, as I
feared we should be, and separated (as
I <i>now</i> fear) for ever! Yet, much as I
grieve for what I lose myself by this
event, still more do I grieve to think,
that what <i>you</i> lose is greater!</p>

<p class='c018'>How much do I now reproach myself,
that when I stole to your tent at midnight
to warn you and the fair partner
of your captivity of what was about to
happen, I should have been so tardy in
acknowledging,—“<i>Count Donat of Carlsheim
is a man not to be trusted</i>.”—Yet forgive
me, Urania; Donat is my brother;
and oh! it is so painful to declare a brother’s
disgrace!</p>

<p class='c018'>I charge you, dear friend, in the name
of Heaven and the Holy Virgin I charge
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>you, suffer not yourself to be deceived
by his perfidious friendship. On your
journey to the Castle seize the first opportunity
of escaping; should you be
once inclosed within the gates of Sargans,
you have nothing to expect but a cruel
death or an ignominious prison; and,
alas for the damsel of Mayenfield! <i>she</i>
has a still more dreadful lot to apprehend!</p>

<p class='c018'>That hypocritical abbot Guiderius, or
whatever be his detested name, who
came to my brother’s camp with his
monks under pretence of pleading in
your behalf, was skilful enough to discover
Count Donat’s darling weakness.
He promised him the possession of a
young beauty, who (according to his account)
was entirely at the Abbot’s disposal.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>My brother, who never confides in the
word of ecclesiastics, insisted on the
immediate accomplishment of this promise;
and the poor Minna was betrayed
into the seducer’s hands. You accompanied
her, and by your presence increased
the ardour with which I had
resolved to labour at preserving the innocent
girl; a service which I had already
rendered to many others, who found
themselves enveloped in the same
snare.</p>

<p class='c018'>I saw you, Urania; oh! how strong
was the sympathy which attracted my
heart towards you, my heart to which
at this moment a friend is so necessary!
It’s true I have a sister; but she.... But
you have already <i>seen</i> Mellusina, and
you shall now <i>know</i> her.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>Mellusina is privy to the designs of
her faithless husband. Nothing but the
promise of overlooking all his errors of
this nature, and the temptation of her
immense wealth, could have induced
Donat to bestow on her the title of his
wife. She is neither lovely in person,
nor amiable in manners; and she bears
a mortal hatred to every woman, who
possesses those advantages which Nature
has denied to herself. I cannot boast
much of her good will towards me;
yet I am compelled to pay my court to
her, that she may not injure me with
my brother, of whose powerful help
my dear unfortunate husband stands at
present but too much in need.</p>

<p class='c018'>I trust a time will come when I may
reveal to you the whole history of my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>sorrows; at present I can only repeat
my warning. Yet surely some invisible
power was disposed last night to give
that warning in my stead! What could
be the cause of that singular and terrific
sensation, which we all felt at that moment,
when Mellusina’s sleep at length
left me at liberty to afford you the information,
which this letter contains?
What was it that startled us all at the
same instant, and made us utter a scream
of fear? What form was it that passed
before us so swiftly? Whence came that
sound, which seemed like a distant bell
tolling? Whose were the cold fingers
which seemed to grasp my neck?——Struck
with an universal terror, we
sprang from our seats at once, and asked
each other—“What was that?”—Even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>the slumbering Mellusina was rouzed
from her insensibility by alarm, and the
hand with which she drew me from
your tent was cold and trembling!</p>

<p class='c018'>Surely, Urania, this <i>must</i> have been
the warning of your guardian angel,
who wished to accomplish that which
Mellusina’s presence forbad my performing
without danger ... unless indeed
I were to give this mysterious event a
different, and a more dreadful meaning!
I know not why, but since that moment
of terror in which we parted, the
thought of my father never quits me
for an instant! I trust no misfortune
has befallen him.—Is he not in the
hands of his son?—Alas! alas! and is
not Donat capable of violating even the
first and most sacred rights of Nature?</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>Oh! good, good father! since I have
seen Urania Venosta, how much more
warmly does my heart glow towards
you with filial affection! How despicable,
how execrable was <i>she</i> described to
be, for whose sake my mother was sacrificed;
and how different did I find her
from the description! Her dignified
air, her interesting countenance, inspired
even the savage Donat with respect!
Oh! surely I have been equally deceived
respecting Count Ethelbert; surely I
shall still enjoy the blessing of being
clasped to the bosom of a <i>virtuous</i>
father!</p>

<p class='c018'>Once again, beloved Urania, be cautious
both with regard to your own
proceedings and Minna’s.—Fail not to
let me know, as soon as possible, what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>passes at the Castle, if your evil genius
decrees that you should be brought
thither, and if an opportunity is
afforded you of answering me by the
faithful messenger, by whom this letter
will be delivered. With regard to myself,
I shall only inform you briefly, that
my intention of warning you was suspected.
Mellusina was commissioned to
watch over me last night, as soon as it
was discovered, that I had stolen to your
tent unknown to my brother and his
wife. In order to prevent the execution
of my good design this morning,
I was forcibly compelled to suffer you to
depart without me for the Castle of Sargans;
and I understand, that my absence
was accounted for to you by the pretence
of sudden illness. I am now setting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>out, by Donat’s orders, for the
convent of St. Mary, at Basle: the Abbess
is my secret friend, and soon after
my arrival you shall hear from me. I
trust, that I shall learn what has happened
to you at the return of my messenger;
and I need not assure you, that
nothing in my power to assist you shall
be neglected for a moment. Farewell!</p>

  <h3 class='c016'><i>Urania Venosta to the Abbess of St. Mary’s.</i></h3>
</div>
<p class='c017'>The explanation which you demand
of me, dear mother, would be very
painful to make. For the benefit of my
husband’s grand-daughters, I have confided
to paper the whole history of my
misfortunes; and the first time that you
visit our Domina, the manuscript shall
be laid before you. For the present I shall
only tell you thus much: From that
fearful moment when an invisible agent
warned me, that misfortune was at hand;
when we all felt, saw, heard something,
which even yet none of us have been
able to describe or understand; when I
saw my earthly guardian angel, <i>your</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>Adelaide and <i>mine</i>, torn from me, and
felt (yet knew not wherefore) that a
separation from her was the signal for
robbing me of all my hopes; from that
moment was I doomed to experience
sorrows, whose bitterness was till then
unknown to me, practised as I was in
the school of suffering.</p>

<p class='c018'>The morning had scarcely broken,
when we set forward for the Castle of
Sargans; illness, as it was said, compelled
Adelaide to remain behind, and
her letter was not delivered till too late
to be of use. Ere we reached the fortress,
intelligence arrived that my unfortunate
husband was no more. Guiderius,
to whom the charge of him had
been committed, had either been too
remiss in watching him, or had trembled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>for his own miserable existence
while exposed to a madman’s fury; or,
as his enemies scrupled not to whisper
(though the fact seems too atrocious for
me to give it credit), had himself been
the means of “ridding the world of an
useless creature.” Such was the expression
used by the insolent vassal, who
informed Count Donat that his father
had perished by an untimely death: I
had the satisfaction of seeing, that the
Count of Carlsheim rewarded the base
wretch as he deserved!</p>

<p class='c018'>The body of Count Ethelbert was
found in the ruined well, into which
(so said the Abbot) he had precipitated
himself in a fit of frantic passion. This
story did not meet with implicit belief;
even Count Donat was openly among
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>the disbelievers. Yet (after I had passed
some time in the prison, which I was
compelled to enter on the very evening
of my arrival at that castle, of which I
was the rightful owner) I was assured
by my jailors that the Abbot of Curwald
was fully reinstated in Count Donat’s
favour, and constantly partook of
the licentious feasts, the noise of whose
riotous pleasures penetrated even to the
depth of my subterraneous dungeon.</p>

<p class='c018'>Yet I was not entirely forsaken. My
guardian angel, my kind protecting
Adelaide suffered no circumstance to
escape her, that might tend to my relief.
On the first evening of our acquaintance
(alas! it was the first and last, for never
since have I been permitted to embrace
the dear one!) I mentioned accidentally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>that the daughters of the Emperor Rudolf
had been my earliest friends and
playmates: from this trifling hint did
Adelaide derive means for effecting my
deliverance. No sooner was she permitted
to leave the convent, in which
her brother at first caused her to be
confined, than she made use of her
liberty to procure mine; and (since she
knew that gentle means would be of no
avail) she endeavoured with the strong
arm of authority to force me out of the
power of my inhuman jailor.</p>

<p class='c018'>She, who in a single interview had
been inspired with so much interest and
compassion for the unfortunate Urania;
she, who in spite of her want of power
was still able to benefit me so much,
could little suspect that six powerful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>Princesses would remain inactive, when
the business was to rescue from misery
the companion of their childhood, the
selected friend of their youth. Alas!
she found herself mistaken: five of Rudolf’s
daughters were the wives of sovereign
Princes; the interests of kingdoms
occupied their attention, and left them
no thought to bestow on her whom
they had once treated as their equal, and
to whom they had sworn at parting firm
friendship and affection without end.
One only of the five (it was Matilda, the
virtuous Duchess of Saxony) listened to
Adelaide’s unwearied intercessions, and
exerted her whole influence to obtain
the Emperor’s interference in my behalf.</p>

<p class='c018'>Her endeavours were at length successful;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>but ere I regained my freedom
many years had elapsed, and by all but
Adelaide’s ardent friendship I was believed
to be no more. During the first
months of my captivity Minna of Mayenfield
had experienced a persecution,
compared to which my dungeon appeared
a Paradise. For its particulars I
refer you to the journal of her imprisonment,
as written by herself: the
Helvetian women even then were well
skilled in guiding the pen, and did not
yield in that noble art to many of the
highest dignitaries of the church. Dear
unfortunate Minna! who can restrain
their tears while reading in your own
affecting language the sad account of
sufferings and trials, almost too difficult
for the strength of a Saint to endure
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>with fortitude or even patience, much less
for an unprotected girl; and yet Minna
passed through the flames victorious!</p>

<p class='c018'>The enamoured Donat neglected no
means of seduction, which might tempt
his virtuous captive from the path of
honour, and in this shameful attempt
Mellusina was his faithful assistant. It
is shocking to think, that a wife should
be so depraved as to aid in removing
the obstacles, which impede her husband
in his licentious pursuits; and that a
woman should forget her sex so far, as
to aim at the destruction of female innocence!
I am persuaded, since the world
was created, there has been but one woman
capable of such unworthy conduct;
and that one was Mellusina.</p>

<p class='c018'>The fascinating arts of seduction having
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>proved vain, they were followed by
violence and ill-treatment; and when,
after passing several months in ignorance
of her fate, Lodowick of Homburg at
length forced Count Donat’s fortress in
search of his bride, he found her in a
subterraneous cell, similar to that in
which I was myself imprisoned. I heard
the tumult occasioned by her deliverance,
and doubted not that my own was
at hand.—Alas! my hopes were vain!
My feeble cries could not reach the hearing
of my friends; they knew not that
those caverns contained any captive except
Minna. Mellusina managed to persuade
my adopted daughter and her
deliverer, that I had paid the debt of Nature.
They shed unavailing tears upon
the grave, which the deceiver pointed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>out to them as mine, while buried alive
beneath the castle’s foundations I shrieked
to them for help in vain; and I sank
from the height of my deceived hopes
into the deepest despair, till time and
faith in God at length restored me to
composure.</p>

<p class='c018'>The only effect resulting to myself
from Minna’s deliverance was, that the
strictness of my imprisonment was increased.
The Count of Homburg’s
desperate enterprize could only have
succeeded, while Donat was absent; and
the latter now seldom left the Castle, lest
similar accidents should occur. They
say, that the fires of the infernal regions
burn doubly fierce, when their monarch
returns from his wanderings on earth;
such too was the case in the Castle of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>Sargans—When their tyrant breathed
the same air with them, the chains of
the poor captives were rendered doubly
heavy, and their sufferings doubly sharp!</p>

<p class='c018'>Yet was he not permitted to kill me,
since Heaven had decreed, that I should
at last see the moment of deliverance.
Adelaide still maintained, that I was in
existence; imperial majesty interfered in
my behalf, and insisted on Donat’s producing
proofs of my death. My tyrant
became embarrassed, and at length proposed
to me that my liberty should be restored,
provided I would voluntarily make
over the whole of my possessions (which
descended to me in right of my uncle)
to the man, who had so long unlawfully
possessed them. I joyfully embraced the
offer. I had long considered liberty as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>the only real wealth; I had long harboured
no other wish than to end my
wretched life in the repose and security
of a cloister!</p>

<p class='c018'>The sacrifice of my inheritance was
completed, and Donat condescended to
conduct me from my prison with his
own hand; he even carried his hypocrisy
so far (when he presented me to
the nobleman who had negociated with
him by order of the Emperor and the
Duchess of Saxony) as to call me “his
kind mother, to whose affection he was
indebted for the greatest part of his possessions.”
Yes! the wretch dared to
profane the name of mother! How ill
would that sacred word have accorded
with the marks of his tyranny, with which
my wrists were still scarred, had it been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>pronounced before impartial hearers?
But the persons into whose charge I was
delivered, were contented with having
obtained my liberty, the only point expressed
in their instructions. Far was
it from the intention of my royal deliverers,
that I should have been compelled
to pay so dearly for my escape from
Donat’s power; but I was myself prepared
to make the sacrifice, and was besides
much too weak to vindicate my
rights against my powerful oppressor.
Those who could have advised me and
acted in my behalf, Edith and her
daughter, were far from me, and still
believed me to be no longer in existence.</p>

<p class='c018'>Under the protection of the imperial
envoys (though in truth their manner
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>of executing their commission had given
me but little reason to believe them
much disposed to protect me) I hastened
to the convent, which I had selected for
my future abode. Yet I left behind me
in Count Donat’s castle a treasure, with
which I was deeply grieved to part, and
which I would most joyfully have taken
with me. During the few days which
want of strength to begin my journey
compelled me to remain his guest, the Count
of Carlsheim thought it proper to shew
me every mark of outward respect; his
attentions, which he forced me to endure,
excited in me only sentiments of
disgust at his hypocrisy, till he presented
to me his daughters, or (as he chose to
call them) my grand-children, whom my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>bounty had destined to be the future
heiresses of Sargans.</p>

<p class='c018'>They were lovely innocent cherubs,
born during the second year of my captivity.
The birth of these twin-sisters
had cost Mellusina her life; and the loss
of a mother so unworthy might have
been reckoned their gain, had not Heaven
abandoned them to the care of a
father, whose example was likely to ruin
them both in body and mind. Oh!
Emmeline! oh! Amalberga! how closely
did you entwine yourselves round my
heart, even in those few days of our
first acquaintance! When I was about
to leave you, you clung to me, wept,
and begged me to take you with me!
Oh! could you but have known what I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>suffered, when I tore myself from your
little arms, Heaven knows how unwillingly!—I
cast a melancholy look on
Count Donat, and in the most humble
manner hazarded a request: but instantly
his brow was clouded with frowns, and
in an ironical tone he asked me—“Whether
I could not confide in his
sincerity without his delivering up hostages?”—</p>

<p class='c018'>Heaven be praised, his sincerity and his
insincerity have been since then a matter
of indifference to me; protected by
these holy walls and the power of the
good Domina of Zurich, I no longer
tremble at the thoughts of Count Donat’s
hatred. Nor have unexpected
causes of rejoicing been denied me, even
in this abode of pious seclusion. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>youngest of the Emperor Rudolf’s
daughters, the gentle and pious Euphemia,
whose grave and prudent air had
made her an object of ridicule to her
sportive sisters and the thoughtless Urania,
and who in the days of petulant
youth had ever been excluded from our
circle and our girlish secrets; Euphemia
was the first, whose open arms received
me on my arrival at the convent of
Zurich. She congratulated me with a
joy, which evidently came from the
heart, on my having reached a place of
security; and she offered me a friendship,
whose value I now first learnt to
estimate, when time and sorrow had
humbled and instructed me.</p>

<p class='c018'>She had learnt my story through her
sister, the Duchess of Saxony, and had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>quitted the convent of Tull, where she
led the life of a Saint, to wait for my
arrival at Zurich, and comfort me in
person for the many sufferings which I
had undergone. I have since had good
reason to believe, that her approach to
Count Donat’s neighbourhood, and her
declared resolution never to rest till she
had obtained my liberty (a resolution
which she took care should reach the
Castle of Sargans), had no slight weight
in influencing the determination of my
tyrant: the wretched Urania would probably
have expired long since in Count
Donat’s dungeons, had not the eyes of
this benevolent Princess been fixed upon
the forlorn one’s destiny!</p>

<p class='c018'>What have I not besides to thank her
for! It is to her that I am indebted for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>a reunion with my beloved Edith and her
daughter, who received me as one just
risen from the dead. It is to her too
that I am indebted for your valuable
friendship, Holy Mother, and for the
hope of once more embracing my preserver,
my sister, my Adelaide! Till
that wished-for moment arrives, never
must you expect me, venerable Lady, to
desist from entreating you to make me
more accurately informed respecting the
past adventures and present situation of
my unequalled friend. I know, they are
both strange and melancholy; and a
cloister is exactly the place, where the
relation of such histories nourish the
emotions of holy pity, and produce a
calm submissive adoration of the wonderful
and mysterious ordinations of that
Providence, which formed and which
governs the world.</p>

    <div class='c000'><i>Adelaide of the Beacon-Tower</i>;</div>
    <div class='c000'>Written by the Abbess of St. Mary’s,</div>
    <div>and addressed to Urania Venosta,</div>
    <div>Countess of Carlsheim and Sargans.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>I must begin, noble Lady, by requesting
your pardon for having delayed
so long to make known to you an history,
which I thought would have more
interest in the mouth of its heroine, than
it could possibly receive from my unskilful
pen. Fatal events (I grieve to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>say it) have for ever deprived you of
that satisfaction; and you must either
learn Adelaide’s adventures from me, or
from no one.</p>

<p class='c018'>Have not these few words already led
you to guess the melancholy truth, which
this letter is intended to break to you?
Oh! that the painful task of being the
first to inform you “that Adelaide is no
more,” had been imposed upon another!
Yet surely it is scarcely possible, that report
should have been totally silent at
Zurich, respecting events which have
excited the attention of the whole German
Empire.</p>

<p class='c018'>Yet dry your tears, virtuous Urania!
they who have lived in the world so
long as we have done, should not grieve
for the departure of our beloved-ones;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>the hope of speedily rejoining them in
another world, never to be separated
from them more, should console us
under this temporary deprivation. Lament
not, that you are prevented from
shewing your gratitude to your generous
deliverer; she will find the reward
of her glorious deeds in Heaven; alas!
she found none on earth!</p>

<p class='c018'>Tell me, dear Adelaide, thou suffering
Saint! Chaste martyr of the holiest love,
say, with what feelings do you now enshrined
in glory review the sorrows,
which oppressed you in your mortal progress?
Doubtless you review them not
with such tears as obscure the eyes of
your friend, while in this mournful hour
of midnight solitude she retraces the
transactions of your eventful life! Methinks
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>I see your form radiant with light
hover round me, and hear you with a
smile bid me weep no more over afflictions,
which now seem to yourself no
longer deserving of a single tear!</p>

<p class='c018'>You see, Urania, how difficult I find
the task of beginning a narrative, which
must rend open anew many an old and
cruel wound; you see how anxiously I
endeavour to delay the executing so
painful a commission. But I gave you
my promise! You shall be satisfied!—Permit
me, however, to be as brief as
possible, and to reserve the relation of
minute particulars till the time, when I
shall have an opportunity of explaining
them to you in person.</p>

<p class='c018'>That which I look upon as the first of
our dear Adelaide’s misfortunes, was her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>being the daughter of Lucretia Malaspina.
Lucretia (you already know but
too well) was not lovely enough to bind
Count Ethelbert’s heart in lasting fetters;
nor did she possess that generous
and almost Saint-like forbearance, with
which Urania supported the misfortunes
necessarily entailed upon the wife of
such an husband. The discovery of an
artifice, which her short-sighted policy
had induced her to practice upon him,
contributed to alienate Ethelbert’s affections,
and to convert what already was
indifference into the most positive
aversion.</p>

<p class='c018'>Lucretia’s wealth was a chief inducement
with the Count of Carlsheim, when
he offered her his hand. The birth of
a son gave occasion to a discovery, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>the estates believed to be her own absolute
property were only held in trust
for her eldest son, to whom they descended
with the first breath of air that
inflated his lungs. Within a year after
Lucretia had been brought to bed for the
first time, to Ethelbert’s infinite surprize
he was summoned to surrender his
wife’s estates to the guardians, appointed
by her uncle’s will to take charge of
them, till the new-born infant should arrive
at years of discretion. Ethelbert’s
rage was extreme; he was compelled to
surrender the property, and in revenge
was barbarous enough to tear the child
from its mother’s arms, commit it to the
care of strangers without informing her
to whom, and then to abandon her with
every expression of hatred and contempt.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>Lucretia bore this parting
(dearly as she loved her incensed husband)
with the more fortitude, from her
secret consciousness that she nourished
in her bosom another innocent creature,
and from her fears that if Ethelbert were
present at the time of her delivery, the
new-born babe would be separated from
her in the same manner, that she had
been deprived of its brother. The same
apprehension, on being brought to bed
of twins, induced her to conceal the birth
of one of them, in order that she might
at least have the pleasure of seeing it
grow up under her own eye, should
Ethelbert’s vengeance induce him to
deprive her of the other. Accident directed
her choice, which fell upon Adelaide.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>The event, however, proved her fears
to have been for this time unfounded.
At a distance from her, and totally engrossed
by his own libertine pursuits,
Ethelbert scarcely deigned to bestow
upon her a single thought. Yet Lucretia’s
partiality for her son Donat, which
every day increased, prevented her from
revealing the birth of his twin-sister, who
would then have had a joint and equal
right with him to those estates, of which
at that period the death of his elder brother
(while yet an infant) made him to
be supposed the sole inheritor. Thus
Adelaide grew up under her mother’s
eyes, and was the play-mate of her brother,
without having the least suspicion
how nearly she was related to either of
them. This was of inconceivable advantage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>to her in her early education.
She believed herself to be a vassal’s
daughter in that house, of which she
ought to have shone as the joint-heiress;
and as the youthful Donat enjoyed all
the advantages of his rank, and made
his dependents feel the whole weight of
his influence, many a lesson of humility
and patient suffering did Adelaide learn
in her youth, which was of material service
to her in the painful scenes, which
she had afterwards to encounter. Donat
ruled his mother with the most
despotic authority; his resemblance to
herself, that violence of passions which
he possessed in common with her, and
the docility with which he received her
pernicious instructions had won Lucretia’s
whole heart, and left no room in it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>for her neglected daughter; who thus
was early afforded frequent opportunities
of submitting to injustice, without
being conscious that her treatment was
unjust.</p>

<p class='c018'>Lucretia had been wise enough to
foresee, long before they arrived, that
such events might very possibly happen,
as actually did at length take place.
With all her love for Ethelbert, she had
discovered his faults sufficiently to make
her take precautions for her own security;
and she endeavoured to confine
his actions by means, which though they
still preserved her the title of his wife,
were nevertheless insufficient to prevent
her suffering the extreme of misery
and disappointment.</p>

<p class='c018'>She knew well, that little as Count
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>Ethelbert <i>loved</i> religion, he greatly <i>dreaded</i>
it: she therefore (previous to their
marriage) insisted on his taking a most
solemn oath, that however they might
disagree, or however his sentiments
might alter, he would never attempt her
life, nor would (even in case of a divorce)
make the offer of his hand to a
rival, as long as she herself should still
be in existence. She thus hoped to bind
her inconstant lover in eternal chains;
but she little dreamt of so tyrannical a
subterfuge, as that by which the hypocrite
contrived to evade the consequences
of his oath.</p>

<p class='c018'>Though she found all endeavours to
regain his affection were vain, she still
watched her husband’s conduct with
jealous eyes. While he visited in turn
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>every Italian state, whose reputation
promised him new means of indulging
his propensity to pleasure, her spies still
pursued him wherever his footsteps
strayed. Lucretia was accurately informed
respecting his intrigues; and seldom
did the objects of Ethelbert’s licentious
passions escape without experiencing
the vengeance of his wife. His short-lived
inclination once gratified, the
Count of Carlsheim heeded but little
what became of his victim, and Lucretia
was suffered to exercise her resentment
unimpeded; but the case was altered,
when Urania Venosta became the mistress
of his heart. Her extraordinary
beauty, her high rank, and her immense
possessions made him at the same time
desirous of becoming her husband,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>hopeless of gratifying the passion with
which she inspired him, except by giving
her his hand. It therefore became absolutely
necessary, that Lucretia should
be removed. He contrived by various
well-imagined artifices to lure her into
Germany; where she had no sooner set
her foot, than he caused her to be seized
privately, and confined in Ravenstein
Castle. A plausible story was then
spread of her having expired suddenly:
no one was interested to dispute the fact,
except her son, who in truth was fondly
attached to her; but his youth and devoted
attention to licentious pursuits
prevented Donat from inquiring minutely
into the circumstances, which attended
his mother’s death. Lucretia
was believed to be no more by all but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>Count Ethelbert, who was thus left at
liberty to pursue his designs upon the
lovely heiress of Sargans.</p>

<p class='c018'>Adelaide had accompanied her mistress
(for such she was taught to believe
her mother) when she quitted Italy; she
refused to be separated from her, followed
her courageously to the Castle of
Ravenstein, and shared with her the
miseries of her long captivity. Then
was it, that the mother’s heart for the
first time felt a sentiment of tenderness
for her rejected daughter. Adelaide
learnt from Lucretia’s lips her real name
and rank, and while she clasped her to
her bosom, was permitted for the first
time to call her mother. Yet was the
severity of her fate but little alleviated
by this discovery. Lucretia’s heart was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>naturally hard; it was incapable of harbouring
so pure a sentiment as that of
true parental love. Long sufferings and
much disappointment had still further
embittered her character. To that kind
of moral delirium, which ever attends
on a corrupted heart, was now frequently
added a temporary alienation of the understanding;
and when Adelaide reflected,
that the wretched woman, whose
complicated misery (both mental and
corporeal) was every moment before her
eyes, was her own mother, the knowledge
of her birth only served to make
her feel a double portion of agony.</p>

<p class='c018'>Day and night was Lucretia employed
in forming plans of revenge against her
cruel husband, and the innocent usurper
of her matrimonial rights. She had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>early taught the innocent Adelaide to
hate Urania Venosta: in the eyes of that
deceived girl the heiress of Sargans was
nothing better than Count Ethelbert’s
abandoned paramour, who had insolently
forced herself into the place of his
lawful wife, and had been the principal
and conscious cause of her mother’s
being confined in that deserted castle.
But in despite of these prejudices against
you, which Lucretia had infused into
the heart of her daughter, she found it
impossible to make her enter cheerfully
into the plans, which she was continually
forming for your destruction. Adelaide
was well aware, that her mother was
totally without the power of carrying
her wicked designs into execution; but
still she could not prevail on herself to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>assume even the appearance of giving
them her approbation. This obstinacy
and incessant contradiction of her hopes
and views at length made her so completely
the object of Lucretia’s aversion,
that she insisted on her daughter’s being
separated from her, and confined in the
deepest dungeon, which the subterraneous
caverns of the Castle could
supply.</p>

<p class='c018'>You are acquainted, Urania, with the
weakness of the man, who was at that
time Castellan of Ravenstein. He possessed
a singular kind of conscience,
which frequently made his actions contradictory.
Lucretia had found means
to send letters to her son in Italy, of
which conduct (as it was not formally
prohibited in his instructions) he affected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>not to take notice; but as he had
been ordered to confine her <i>rigorously</i>,
she found it impossible to obtain from
him the slightest alleviation of her sufferings.
Again, as Adelaide had been delivered
to his custody at the same time
with her mother, no entreaties could
prevail on him to restore her to liberty;
but it required but little persuasion to
make him believe, that she ought to
submit to the punishment, which the
person (whom he believed to be her
mistress) thought proper to inflict on
her.</p>

<p class='c018'>Adelaide therefore was separated from
her unnatural mother. She was removed
to a subterraneous cell, whose strength
proved the means of preserving her on
that dangerous night, when Lucretia in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>despair and frenzy enveloped the whole
fortress in flames. The fire raged above
her; but she knew not what occasioned
the confusion, which seemed to have taken
place in the Castle. Her wretched mother
died without mentioning her name,
and her corse was committed to the
earth unknown to her daughter. The
deliverance of Urania and the Countess
of Mayenfield was effected; the Castellan,
who alone knew the place of her
confinement, had been dangerously hurt
during the conflagration, and in his last
moments was too much occupied by the
terrors of approaching dissolution to
bestow a thought on his prisoner. No
one knew what was become of the poor
Adelaide; no one enquired, no one
cared.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>Scarcely had you escaped from Ravenstein
through the well-imagined device
of Walter Forest and his followers, before
your jailors began to suspect the
truth. A variety of circumstances combined
to prove that they had been over-reached,
and they were enabled to see
the whole adventure in its true light.
In truth, nothing but the rashness of
the attempt and the rapidity of its execution
could have prevented them from
making this discovery sooner.</p>

<p class='c018'>They were provoked beyond measure
at the contemptible part, which they had
played on this occasion; too much time
had already elapsed to leave them any
hopes of over-taking the fugitives, and
to pursue them now had been only
giving themselves unavailing trouble.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>When they reflected on the wrath of
their tyrannical lord, terror almost
turned their blood into ice. It was
evident, that nothing could preserve
them from destruction, but immediate
flight from a place, whose natural horrors
were increased tenfold by the
ravages of the late conflagration, and by
the recollection of many a cruel action,
which they had committed within those
dreary walls!</p>

<p class='c018'>Flight then was resolved upon unanimously;
but they thought it as well, not
to quit Ravenstein with empty hands.
It’s true, the whole wealth, that was to
be found there above ground, consisted
in chains, rusty armour, and instruments
of torture; but report had assured them,
that treasures of immense value lay concealed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>in the subterraneous parts of the
Castle, and these they determined not
to leave behind them.</p>

<p class='c018'>They tore open the bosom of the rock,
on which the Castle was situated, without
discovering aught but Adelaide’s
dungeon, in which she was found almost
at the point of death, not having tasted
nourishment for several days. They
were humane enough to remove the
unfortunate girl into a purer atmosphere,
and to exert themselves in some measure
to effect her recovery. Her beauty
probably was of some use in persuading
the younger part of the garrison to
assist her the more readily; and what
little wealth she possest in jewels (the
only presents of her unnatural mother)
purchased for her the protection of the
more ancient and flinty-hearted.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>While they were busied in attending
upon her, she heard them talk much respecting
the escape of two ladies, who
as well as Lucretia and herself had been
prisoners at Ravenstein: she also heard
Walter Forest mentioned as their deliverer,
for Count Ethelbert’s deceived
soldiers had by that time discovered who
their deceiver <i>really</i> was, and where he
resided. On these hints did Adelaide
build a plan for her escape from the society
of these lawless ruffians, for whose
temporary mercy (she saw clearly) she
was only indebted to her illness and to
the hurry of their preparations for flight.
At the risk of her life therefore did she,
in spite of her weak condition, take the
advantage of a stormy night to escape
from the Castle, and hasten to the tranquil
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>valley inhabited by that friend of
the opprest, Walter Forest; who failed
not to receive the poor Adelaide also
with the same openness and hospitality,
with which he had received ourselves.</p>

<p class='c018'>She rewarded his kindness by apprizing
him of the attack, with which he
had been threatened by the soldiery of
Ravenstein in revenge for the artifice, by
which he had contrived the escape of
their captives. The warning however
proved unnecessary, for the cowardly
vassals of the Count of Carlsheim had
already altered their plans. Adelaide’s
flight had ruined their hopes of falling
upon Walter by surprize; they did not
dare to attack openly the brave inhabitants
of the Frutiger Valley; and they
judged it more prudent on many accounts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>to proceed without delay to request
protection of the Lords of Eschenbach
from the resentment of the Count
of Carlsheim. Ravenstein Castle had
originally belonged to the family of Eschenbach;
the protection asked was
readily granted; the rebellious vassals of
Count Ethelbert took the oath of allegiance
to their new master, and the shattered
towers of Ravenstein Castle were
delivered into his possession.</p>

<p class='c018'>In the mean while Adelaide, under the
escort of some of Walter Forest’s people,
arrived in safety at the place, to
which she had desired to be conducted.
She knew in what part of Italy Donat
was then resident; and as the prejudices,
with which she had been inspired against
Count Ethelbert and his second wife,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>prevented her seeking a refuge in her
paternal mansion, there seemed for her
no proper abode except with her brother.
Her reception was kinder, than
she had expected from her experience
of Donat’s unfeeling nature. He was
young, and indulged himself to excess
in the pleasures of voluptuous Italy: if
his dissolute mode of life had not bettered
his heart, it had at least made it
softer, and more accessible to compassion,
when the indulgence of that sentiment
did not interfere with his own
gratifications.  Therefore though he
listened with impatience to Adelaide’s
melancholy account of her mother’s
sufferings in Ravenstein Castle, and suffered
his pleasures to make him put off
from day to day the affording Lucretia
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>that aid, of which her daughter (who
was still ignorant of her decease) never
ceased to assure him, she stood so much
in need: still was he not without compassion
for the helpless situation of his
sister, nor so blind to merit, as to reject
the title of brother to a creature so amiable
and so deserving. Of their relationship
he had no doubt; Adelaide had
brought with her the acknowledgment
of her birth written by Lucretia’s own
hand; and had other proofs been wanting,
the strong resemblance imprest by
Nature on the features of Donat and his
sister would have left the spectator no
doubt, that they sprang from the same
parents.</p>

<p class='c018'>Adelaide, however, soon discovered,
that she could not long accept with propriety
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>the protection afforded her in her
brother’s house. Count Donat was surrounded
day and night by a swarm of
youthful libertines, who sported in the
sunshine of his wealth, assisted him in
his licentious pursuits, and were his
companions in all the excesses of his unrestrained
habits of enjoyment. His
lovely sister became the general object
of their insolent addresses; and Donat
had neither firmness of mind nor love
of reputation sufficient to guard her
against their importunities.</p>

<p class='c018'>She entreated permission to retire into
a convent; but this was refused her
with too much anger and determination
to permit her making the request a second
time. She therefore found herself
compelled to give her hand to one of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>her admirers, who might at least protect
her from the insults of the rest; and
fortunately both for him and for myself,
the man who was least displeasing to
her among the number, was Rodolpho
of the Beacon-Tower; was my brother.
I have to thank <i>him</i> for the happiness of
calling one of the best of created women
by the name of friend; I have to thank
<i>her</i> for having snatched from the jaws
of ruin the dear but erring youth, whom
I loved, though but his sister, with affection
not less fervent than a mother’s!</p>

<p class='c018'>At that time I resided in an Italian
cloister, sufficiently near the theatre of
Count Donat’s exploits for the report
of them to reach me, and to make me
bewail the fate of those, who were
drawn by his example into the whirlpool
of licentiousness.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>Alas! the intelligence at length reached
me, that my unfortunate brother was
one of the young Count of Carlsheim’s
most distinguished companions in his
profligate career. Mutual friendship
united them; and Rodolpho’s warm
heart and too yielding nature made him
look upon it as the highest pitch of human
glory, when he trod in the footsteps
of his abandoned friend.</p>

<p class='c018'>My warnings and remonstrances had
no effect upon the poor misguided
youth. You must be well aware, dear
Urania, that instructions coming from
the mouth of a Nun are little regarded
by the worldly, merely because it <i>is</i> a
Nun who speaks them. Very different
was the effect of those reproofs, which
the lovely Adelaide condescended to bestow
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>on her admirer. I have already
told you, that among the Damsel of
Carlsheim’s suitors my brother was the
man who displeased her the least; and
this is the strongest term which can be
applied to her sentiments towards him
at that period. It is true, Rodolpho
was esteemed (and that justly) the handsomest
youth in Italy; but Adelaide’s
mind was too elevated to suffer her
heart to be captivated by the mere glare
of a pleasing exterior. The man, whom
she now honoured with her choice,
would undoubtedly have been seen by
her with as much indifference as his
worthless companions, had she not
found some traces of manly sense in his
bewildered brain, and in his erring heart
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>some still surviving sparks of the love
of virtue.</p>

<p class='c018'>What cannot female beauty, when
united with solid sense and a feeling
mind, effect upon a being, who is not
yet totally lost to every sense of goodness?
Guided by the hand of Adelaide,
already had Rodolpho retraced many a
step in the paths of vice: she made his
immediate departure from the theatre of
his follies the only condition, on which
she would bestow on him her hand.
He loved her; he complied: Adelaide
became my sister, and my brother was
entirely rescued.</p>

<p class='c018'>Oh! dearest Adelaide, how heartily
did I thank you (when bidding you farewell)
for removing from the dangers of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>Italy a man, whom I knew to be as safe
in your arms, as under the wings of his
protecting angel! Willingly did I part
with him, since he left me but to follow
the path of virtue, in which you knew
how to guide him so well!</p>

<p class='c018'>She was no sooner Rodolpho’s wife,
than Adelaide insisted on his immediately
performing his promise to quit
Italy: she saw, that her personal remonstrances
had no power to hasten Donat’s
departure for Ravenstein; and she was
obliged to content herself with receiving
from him the most solemn assurances,
that he would proceed to liberate his
unfortunate mother without further delay;
assurances, which he had frequently
made before, and which were performed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>no better on this, than they had been on
former occasions.</p>

<p class='c018'>Adelaide, advised her husband (who
could refuse nothing to her entreaties)
to accompany her to the Court of the
German Emperor, where there was no
doubt of his easily obtaining an employment
suited to his rank and talents. Rodolpho
had but one objection to offer
against taking this step. Rudolf of
Hapsburg had been succeeded in the
imperial throne by Adolphus of Nassau.
This unfortunate monarch, who was long
the friend and benefactor of our family,
was cut off in the middle of his glorious
career by the sword of Albert of Austria;
and his crown became the prey of the
powerful conqueror, whose brows it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>still decorated. My father lost his life
in defence of his sovereign at the battle
of Worms; and his last words commanded
his son Rodolpho (who together
with many other young Knights made
on that day his first trial in arms) to
revenge the deaths of his father and his
sovereign.</p>

<p class='c018'>This dying injunction was the reason,
why Rodolpho had hitherto refused to
accept any employment from the successful
Albert; and as good intentions
frequently produce bad effects, the want
of proper occupation had betrayed him
into that dissolute course of life, from
which he was snatched by Adelaide.
This dying injunction was the cause also
of his being still unwilling to lay himself
under obligations to one, whom he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>had long been accustomed to call by no
other name, than that of the “regicide
Albert.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Adelaide however prevailed at length
over all his objections; he entered into
the Imperial service, and endeavoured
to forget, that the man, whom he acknowledged
as his master, was the murderer
of the beloved and still regretted
Adolphus: yet frequently no influence
less strong than Adelaide’s would have
been able to repress the ebullitions of
that struggling resentment, which still
existed in his bosom, and to retain him
firm in the path of his duties. However,
in spite of his disinclination to Albert’s
service, he proved himself to be
a hero on all warlike occasions; and
often did he express the warmest gratitude
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>to his wife for having rescued him
from his ignominious effeminacy, and
excited the dormant flame of valour in
his bosom.</p>

<p class='c018'>Still he lost no opportunity of showing,
that Albert’s yoke sat heavy upon
him, and that he desired nothing more
ardently than to exchange the Imperial
service for some other. Dissentions
arose between the Emperor and his two
sons, the Margraves Dietman and Frederick;
Rodolpho failed not to side with
the latter, and became their father’s prisoner.
The unfortunate Adelaide could
of herself do nothing to assist her husband,
and hastened to implore for him
her brother’s powerful interference.</p>

<p class='c018'>Count Donat’s situation had undergone
material changes during her absence.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>She had left him, not only in
possession of the large domains bequeathed
him by his maternal grandfather,
but the favourite of a Prince who
loaded him with favours and wealth.
Sudden death had deprived him of this
powerful protector; his unbounded extravagance
had exhausted his treasures;
and no means of rescuing himself from
the most degrading state of poverty was
left him, except an union with a person
incapable of inspiring him with the least
affection; and who had nothing to recommend
her to his choice except her
immense property, and her childish
passion for this handsome libertine.
Shortly before Rodolpho’s imprisonment
had Mellusina become the wife of Count
Donat; and on Adelaide’s arrival in Italy,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>she understood, that her brother had at
length set out on his long-promised expedition
to Ravenstein Castle.</p>

<p class='c018'>Thither she followed him, and was
politely though coldly received by her
new sister-in-law. Mellusina gave herself
out to be a natural daughter of the
deceased Emperor Adolphus; and she
believed herself entitled by so illustrious
an origin to treat every one else with
haughtiness and contempt. Had she
had any other resource, never would
Adelaide have accepted the protection
which was here afforded her with such
insolent condescension; but friendless
and destitute as was her present situation,
she now could do nothing but
suffer and submit.</p>

<p class='c018'>She found her brother too much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>occupied by his own projects to bestow
a single thought upon the affairs of
others. He listened not to the imploring
voice of his sister; he heeded not
the misfortunes of his former friend.
Grief for the untimely death of his mother,
who had perished through his
inattention to her prayers, and projects
of revenue against those whom he accused
of her sufferings, engrossed his
every thought. Adelaide could obtain
nothing from him, except a promise of
assistance when he should have satisfied
his animosity against Lucretia’s murderers;
and instead of seeing him lead his
forces to the fortress in which her husband
languished, she was obliged to follow
him to Sargans, where she had many
a painful scene to undergo, of which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>you, dear Urania, were partly a witness.</p>

<p class='c018'>Sorrow and self-reproach; the disappointment
of his too highly-raised youthful
expectations; his union with a woman
whom he hated; and above all the
consequences of a life passed in scenes
of the most unbridled profligacy, a ruined
constitution and an accusing conscience;
all these together had hardened
Count Donat’s heart, and embittered
his temper; had annihilated his few
good qualities, and had left his bad ones
visible in the full extent of their enormity.
His misanthropic heart longed
for a suitable employment, and only
waited for an excuse to make others feel
the tortures, which preyed upon himself.
The sight of Adelaide brought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>more strongly to his mind the recollection
of his wretched mother, whom he
had so long forgotten, and who had so
vainly applied to her son for help: he
remembered well, how often his sister
had implored him to set forward for Ravenstein,
and had warned him, that his
mother’s death might probably be the
consequence of his delay. The more he
reflected, the more fierce became his
rage; and he determined to proceed to
Rhætia, revenge his mother, and exact
from his father a severe account respecting
her long imprisonment and miserable
death. It was also his design to
enforce his right to his paternal estates,
from which Count Ethelbert (incensed
at the discovery of Lucretia’s artifice in
regard to her supposed possessions) had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>disinherited his children by his first
wife.</p>

<p class='c018'>Count Ethelbert and Urania Venosta
had been described to Adelaide in the
most odious colours; notwithstanding
which, she shuddered, while listening to
the threats which her brother breathed
against them. How did the sight rend
her gentle heart, when she saw the
avenger’s sword raised by the son against
his father! Her prayers, her remonstrances
had no effect upon Count Donat
and his ambitious wife, who founded
on Ethelbert’s ruin plans for their own
future greatness. During her abode at
Ravenstein, Adelaide discovered for the
first time the natural cruelty of her brother’s
disposition: report cannot have
permitted you to remain ignorant, with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>what torrents of blood the furious Donat
inundated the vales of Frutiger. The
anxiety and terror, with which you received
the news of his approach towards
your residence, sufficiently prove that
you were aware, how little hope you entertained
of escaping from his frantic
fury.</p>

<p class='c018'>Adelaide was aware of it also; and
she trembled, if not for her unknown
step-mother, at least for her unfortunate
father, who (tyrant as she believed him
to be) she still thought possest from Nature
an authority over his children,
which no conduct of his could forfeit,
however criminal. The distrest daughter
would have suffered still more severely
from apprehension, founded on
reasons but too strong; had she not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>seized a lucky moment of unusual good
humour to obtain a solemn oath from
Donat, that Ethelbert’s life should be
held sacred by him, and that she never
should endure the agony of seeing her
brother’s hands stained with the blood
of their common father.</p>

<p class='c018'>Dreadful is it to think, that such a
promise should have ever been reckoned
necessary! In truth, Count Donat himself
felt the bitter reflection conveyed in
Adelaide’s request; and while he yielded
to her importunity, he chid her with
severity for harbouring such ungrounded
suspicions. I am persuaded, that Donat
was not quite the monster at that
time, which he appeared to be when
seen in his moments of frantic passion;
nay, I am inclined from a variety of motives
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>to ascribe to him a very trifling
share in that melancholy transaction,
whose real circumstances are covered
with a veil of impenetrable obscurity,
and whose execution was too barbarous
for me to attribute it even to the base
Guiderius himself. Doubtless Count
Ethelbert’s miserable end was effected
by a sudden burst of frenzy; in a moment
of terror and despair his own hand
inflicted on himself the punishment of
former errors, and (I fear!) of former
crimes!</p>

<p class='c018'>You appeared at Count Donat’s camp,
Urania, to solicit the pardon of your
wretched guilty husband. To see you
was sufficient to obtain for you Adelaide’s
affection, and to annihilate every
prejudice, which had so carefully been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>instilled into her mind against you. She
endeavoured to make you aware of the
dangers which threatened you; but obstacles
both visible and invisible interposed,
to prevent your preservation.
Your friend’s unwillingness to speak ill
of a brother; Mellusina’s unexpected
intrusion and persevering stay in your
tent; and above all, that singular and
inexplicable occurrence which made the
whole society separate in such terror, all
combined to retain you in the road,
destined to lead you into long captivity.</p>

<p class='c018'>Never could Adelaide mention without
shuddering the mysterious adventure
of that night. She ever anxiously
avoided speaking on the subject, and referred
me to you for more accurate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>information. However, the account
which in compliance with my request
you forwarded to me, was nothing more
than that, which I had already heard from
my sister-in-law: anxiety to unravel this
mystery made me even have recourse
to Mellusina, but without success. Her
account of the matter was no less obscure,
strange, and unaccountable.</p>

<p class='c018'>The next morning, her brother thought
it adviseable to prevent Adelaide from
accompanying you to the Castle of Sargans,
and therefore gave out, that she
was taken ill unexpectedly. In truth,
this was no pretended indisposition.
The supposed interference of a spiritual
being had made the strongest impression
upon her imagination; and when Count
Donat’s attendants delivered her up to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>my charge (he was then ignorant, how
closely she was connected with the Abbess
of St. Mary’s) her situation was
such, that you cannot easily picture it
to yourself too melancholy—The return
of the messenger, whom she had dispatched
to you, only served to increase
her illness; he communicated to her
without sufficient precaution the news
of her unfortunate father’s miserable
death, and added to it the account of
your ill-treatment and captivity. Like
all who are possest of sensibility too
acute, she loaded herself with reproaches
for not having taken measures to prevent
these heavy misfortunes; and it
was long, before the soothing of friendship
could succeed in pacifying her.
To complete her distress but one thing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>more was necessary, and it arrived: a
report prevailed (and was universally
credited) that her husband had fallen a
victim to the Emperor’s resentment.
As Superior of St. Mary’s cloister, I
could have afforded my poor sister a
secure and agreeable shelter within these
tranquil walls; but the desire to weep
over her husband’s grave, and her anxiety
to rescue you from the dungeon in
which you languished, compelled her to
return once more into the hated world.
She was conscious, that you were the
captive of a man, whose cruelty was
but too well known to her; and she
vowed solemnly never to rest, till she
had broken the chains imposed upon you
so unjustly.</p>

<p class='c018'>She saw too plainly, that the united
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>forces of the Counts of Mayenfield and
Homburg would be unable to force you
out of the power of the mighty Lord of
the domains of Carlsheim and Sargans,
besides both Edith and her daughter
were persuaded of your death, and
looked on Adelaide’s assertions of your
existence in Donat’s dungeons, as being
the mere effusions of that enthusiastic
affection, which easily believes whatever
it wishes to be true. But no representations,
no neglect could induce your
protectress to lay aside her hopes of
effecting your deliverance; and she addrest
herself to the Emperor Rudolf’s
daughters, whose powerful interference
she trusted would easily obtain your
release.</p>

<p class='c018'>Of all those powerful Princesses, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>Duchess of Saxony alone (the virtuous
Matilda, whose own domestic misfortunes
might have furnished her with a
sufficient excuse in the world’s estimation,
for declining to embarrass herself
with the affairs of others) exerted herself
seriously in your behalf. Her sister
Euphemia, retired in a convent and forgotten
by the world, had little to offer
toward your release except good wishes;
yet what little she <i>could</i> offer, she offered
gladly, and shared her sister’s joy at the
news of your deliverance. I understand,
that this royal Nun will soon exchange
her convent at Tull for that which you
inhabit, solely from the wish to end her
life in your society. Oh! Urania, how
greatly does all that I hear of you increase
my desire to know you personally!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>What unusual merit must that
woman possess, who could obtain so
warm and unabating an interest in the
hearts of three of the noblest of created
beings, Euphemia, Matilda, and my poor
Adelaide!</p>

<p class='c018'>Yet I forget too long the heroine of
my history, while occupying myself
with Urania; I resume the thread of my
narrative. Adelaide found at Emperor
Albert’s court, (whither she repaired to
plead in your behalf in person) that an
happiness was reserved for her, which
she had never expected to enjoy again
on this side the grave: her husband was
still living. The same false report,
which had persuaded her of his death,
had taken no less pains to persuade Rodolpho,
that she was faithless. Her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>journey to Italy for the purpose of persuading
her brother to interfere in behalf
of her imprisoned Lord; the expedition
to Sargans, in which she was
obliged to accompany Count Donat; the
length of time, which elapsed without
his knowing what had become of her,
and which she had past in my convent
almost at the point of death; these and
a variety of other circumstances had all
been represented to Rodolpho in the
most odious light. In his dungeon
(whence he had but lately been released
on the reconciliation between the Emperor
and his sons) it was impossible for
him to detect the falsehood of these reports;
but Adelaide needed but to shew
herself to the man who loved her with
such unbounded affection, and all his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>injurious suspicions were annihilated at
once. A few words were sufficient to
persuade him of the truth; a truth,
which was confirmed by the testimony
of those, under whose eyes she had been
residing.</p>

<p class='c018'>What tongue is capable of describing
the reunion of two lovers long separated;
it is a fore-taste of that reunion, which
we expect to enjoy with the objects of
our affection beyond the grave, in another
world better and happier. The
one saw her belief in the untimely death
of her beloved dissolved like a painful
dream; the other saw those stains removed,
which had sullied her purity on
whom his soul doated; both felt, that
the turbulent raptures of their early love
were less sweet, than this renewal of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>their long-tried affection! Forgive me,
Urania; a cloistered Nun ought not to
describe such emotions, though she cannot
help feeling them: doubtless, you
understand such things better than we
do, who have been confined from our
earliest years within the walls of a convent,
and shut out from the most precious
rights of human nature.</p>

<p class='c018'>From this moment began the most
fortunate part of our friend’s life. Adelaide
found her husband improved by
years and corrected by adversity; absence
and misfortune had made him still
dearer to her; and she now first felt towards
him the whole excess of love, of
which her affectionate heart was capable.
She now had no other wish, than to
enjoy her happiness in quiet and retirement.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>The Lords of Eschenbach had
new-built the fortress of Ravenstein,
and proffered it to her husband (who
had long been united with them in
amity) as a fit residence, should it be no
longer agreeable for him to remain at
the Court of the offended Emperor.
Gladly would Adelaide have hastened
thither; but Rodolpho had contracted
obligations, which at that time prevented
him from immediately quitting the
Court. He was indebted for life, for
freedom, for opulence, to the favour of
a princely youth, whom it was only
necessary to see in order to admire;
and whose situation it was only necessary
to know, in order to feel interested
for him, even had Rodolpho not been
so closely bound to him by the ties of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>gratitude. This man was the cause,
why Adelaide’s husband found it impossible
to comply with her request.</p>

<p class='c018'>Need I name to you this noble, this
dangerous youth? Alas! who has not
heard of the unfortunate John of Swabia;
who does not pity and detest in
him at once the injured Prince, and the
lawless avenger of those injuries?—Wretched
youth! what have you gained
by that rash and detestable action, to
which you were guided by evil counsellors?
In what climate do you wander
accursed like the first murderer, without
being able to fly from your own conscience,
and what will be at last the goal to
which your painful wanderings lead?</p>

<p class='c018'>The young Duke of Swabia, at the
period when Rodolpho attached himself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>to his fortunes, was not the criminal,
which he is now become through passionate
rashness, and through impatience
under the pressure of adversity: the epithet,
which is now affixed to his name,
and which probably will be transmitted
to the latest posterity, at that time would
have made him recoil with horror.
Young, amiable, and unfortunate, he
created an interest in every bosom.
Even Adelaide (whose prudent foresight
made her from the very beginning
augur some misfortune to arise from
this close intimacy between the Prince
and her husband) could not prevent herself
from feeling well-disposed towards
him: she was compelled to own, that in
his complaints against his unjust guardian
the Emperor, who withheld from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>him his paternal inheritance, he had
justice on his side; and she earnestly
wished, that he might soon obtain the
redress of his crying injuries.</p>

<p class='c018'>I told you, that Adelaide had from the
first observed with uneasiness her husband’s
intimacy with the Duke of Swabia;
in truth, when the situation and
characters of both were considered, it
was impossible for her to feel otherwise
on the subject. Prince John was fiery
and impatient, an avowed lover of pleasure,
and provided by his crafty uncle
with ample means for indulging in every
excess. The Emperor Albert saw his
own advantage in leading the youth
(whose happiness he sought to undermine)
into labyrinths, whence he would
find it an hard task to extricate himself.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>He thought, that the errors, which he
furnished Prince John with opportunities
of committing, would excuse his
own unjust proceedings towards his nephew;
and unfortunately to lead the
youth into the snare was a task but too
easily effected.</p>

<p class='c018'>With grief of heart must I confess it,
in the principal features of his character
Rodolpho resembled his friend very
closely. Adelaide’s influence, it’s true,
had for a time represt those inclinations
to libertinism, which he so early contracted
in Count Donat’s school: still
had she not succeeded in extirpating
them so completely, as to prevent their
obtaining their former mastery over his
better judgment occasionally, now that
opportunities for their indulgence were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>continually in his way. Rodolpho had
a sufficient advantage over the young
Prince in point of years, to have entitled
him to be his guide in the paths of virtue;
but instead of leading his friend to
good, he too often suffered himself to be
seduced by him into actions, which
were very far from being the most respectable.
You may conceive, how much
anxiety her husband’s want of steadiness
must have excited in the mind of our
friend; and that anxiety was increased
by the dark clouds, which she could
perceive rising in another quarter.</p>

<p class='c018'>That the Lord of the Beacon-Tower
was no partial admirer of the Emperor,
was a fact well known to every one. In
unguarded moments his own tongue had
often avowed his real sentiments respecting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>the regicide Albert, and the deceased
Adolphus; the readiness with
which he embraced the quarrel of the
young Margraves had proved, that he
was not unwilling to shew his resentment
by actions as well as words; and
it was not necessary for him to connect
himself so intimately with the young
Duke of Swabia, in order to make himself
an object of hatred and suspicion at
the imperial court. Albert was silent,
but his silence was menacing and terrible;
and Adelaide had already acquired
sufficient knowledge of the manners of
the great to guess, that the anger (which
regard for his own safety restrained him
from venting on the prince) would one
day burst on the heads of his unprotected
friends; among whom the Lord
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>of the Beacon-Tower being the most
distinguished, would not fail to receive
the largest share of vengeance.</p>

<p class='c018'>—“Oh! let us fly, my beloved!”
often exclaimed Adelaide in her moments
of apprehension; “let us away to the
tranquil vale of Frutiger. Here we
breathe no air but such sultry parching
blasts, as seem to warn us of an approaching
tempest. With every moment the
gloom increases; the clouds collect
together; the lightning will soon break
loose and destroy us!”——</p>

<p class='c018'>Rodolpho’s answers to these remonstrances
were seldom such as to give
her cause for satisfaction. He talked
much of the future greatness of his
friend, never spoke of Albert without
attaching the word “Regicide” to his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>name, and frequently recalled to mind his
father’s dying command to revenge the
murder of Adolphus. Adelaide’s anxiety
grew daily more acute: she redoubled
her importunity, that her husband
should quit the court; and as she was
now in such a situation as gave Rodolpho
hopes of an event, which he had
long desired in vain, he trembled, lest
the too violent agitation of her mind
should injure her health materially. He
therefore determined for the first time to
conceal his sentiments from the woman
whom he adored, and to lead her into
an error respecting the real state of
affairs, which became with every day
more critical and serious.</p>

<p class='c018'>Among his dependents was a young
man of noble birth but fallen fortunes,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>by name Russeling; he had formerly been
in the service of the Duke of Swabia,
and had been employed by him to
effect Rodolpho’s deliverance from the
emperor’s chains.  This circumstance
had greatly endeared him to his present
patron, who did not perceive that he
harboured in Russeling a seducer, whose
object was to guide him to the commission
of a crime the most atrocious. This
man was one of those concealed enemies,
who are frequently more dangerous
to princes, than those whose armies
ravage their dominions, and who openly
threaten the subversion of their
thrones. Ancient animosity, which had
descended from father to son through
a long line of ancestors undiminished,
lived in his rancorous heart against the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>emperor: he secretly fanned every spark
of hatred, which existed in other bosoms;
his every word infused additional bitterness
towards his uncle into the
heart of the Duke of Swabia, to whose
person he had still free access; and he
kindled again in the heart of my unfortunate
brother that flame, which Adelaide
with her soothing had so anxiously
laboured to extinguish.</p>

<p class='c018'>The betrayer perceived, that no one
crossed him in his evil designs more
than the wife of his patron; he therefore
exerted his utmost skill to effect
her removal from the scene of action.</p>

<p class='c018'>Rodolpho had frequently advised her
to quit the turbulent court, and pass
the time of her approaching confinement
in the retired Castle near the Lake
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>of Thun, which she had herself marked
out as the future scene of her domestic
happiness. Hitherto his entreaties had
been in vain: she could not resolve to
abandon her husband while exposed to
all the dangers, in which the Duke of
Swabia’s intimacy had involved him.
But now that Rodolpho had prevailed
on himself to use dissimulation with
her, who had never deceived him in the
slightest trifle; and now that Russeling
with his serpent’s tongue had thrown
out hints respecting the views of the
Duke of Swabia, which led her to
suspect (perhaps unjustly) that his
marked attention to her proceeded from
a passion disgraceful both to her and to
the prince; Adelaide however reluctantly
was compelled to give up her opinion.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>Flight, she now thought, would be the
only remaining means of destroying the
duke’s presumptuous hopes, without
drawing down his resentment upon her
husband. Besides, she greatly needed
some respite from the tumultuous and
turbulent residence of the court; and
every anxiety respecting Rodolpho was
removed by his solemn assurance, that
it should not be long, ere he rejoined
her, never again to quit the repose and
security of rural life.</p>

<p class='c018'>Yet bitter was the parting between
these married lovers. Both were tormented
by forebodings of misfortune;
both felt the pangs of an affection, which
made them wish never to be separated;
and yet each was still compelled to acknowledge,
that to separate was necessary!</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>With difficulty did they tear themselves
from each other’s arms. By his
patron’s desire, Russeling conducted
the Lady of the Beacon-Tower to the
place appointed for her abode: but as
soon as he had seen her established there,
he hastened back to the imperial residence,
anxious to lose no opportunity
of advancing his projects. As unfortunately
every circumstance combined
to favour them, his detestable schemes
were but too soon carried into execution.</p>

<p class='c018'>In the mean while, Adelaide in the
solitude of Ravenstein led the kind of
life best adapted to her melancholy
situation. The present posture of affairs
rendered her heart doubly accessible
to every sort of inquietude: she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>had left her dear but unsteady husband
entangled in a chain of circumstances,
which authorized her to see the future
in the most gloomy light; nor was it
long before she discovered, that in fixing
her abode at the fortress of Ravenstein,
she had by no means selected a
residence the best fitted for dissipating
the melancholy ideas, which perpetually
obtruded themselves upon her imagination.</p>

<p class='c018'>In the spring of her life this Castle
had been long her prison; there had
she narrowly escaped perishing by
famine and by the flames; there too was
the grave of her unfortunate mother.
It was impossible, that these sad recollections
should not have considerable
effect upon a mind, which already was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>tortured by a thousand causes for
anxiety. It is true, the lords of Eschenbach
had almost entirely rebuilt the
ruined fortress at considerable expence,
and had made it so different from its
former self, that it was scarcely to be
recognized; but Adelaide’s enthusiastic
imagination saw less what was before
her eyes, than what sorrow had engraved
on her remembrance indelibly.</p>

<p class='c018'>The time of her delivery was at hand;
and the presence of some sympathising
friends enabled Adelaide to look forward
to the moment of danger with
less fear. Indeed, the laws of our
order did not permit either you or myself
to leave our convents, and hasten to
the assistance of our beloved Adelaide.
The Countess Mellusina was no more;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>and even had she been still in existence,
her presence would have been but little
wished or expected by her sister-in-law.
I doubt much too, whether (even had
we been able to come to her aid) with
all our good intentions we should have
been able to afford so much real help
and comfort, as she received from the
female inhabitants of the vale of Frutiger:
during the time which she past
with Count Donat at Ravenstein, Adelaide
by her exertions to moderate the
fury of her incensed brother had won
their hearts completely; and no sooner
did the grateful women hear, that their
benevolent protectress stood in need of
it, than they hastened to afford her
their friendly assistance. Walter Forest’s
mother, and the wife of Henric
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>Melthal, (for Donat’s increasing tyranny
had compelled the family of Melthal to
withdraw from his dominions) were
among the first to proffer their services;
nor did Gertrude Bernsdorf neglect the
daughter of her former lord. It was
from these good matrons, that I received
the account of the following transactions;
alas! I was not permitted to
hear them from the lips of the dear
Adelaide herself!</p>

<p class='c018'>The Lady of the Beacon-Tower was
safely delivered of a son; and the
sight of this little smiling innocent was
sufficient to relieve his anxious mother
from more than half the weight of her
melancholy.</p>

<p class='c018'>—“Now then,” she exclaimed frequently,
while she kissed her baby with
rapture, “now then I only need to see
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>Rodolpho partaking my delight, and
every fear which now distracts my
bosom will at once be destroyed for
ever.”——</p>

<p class='c018'>Her wish was granted, sooner than she
could have expected. Alas! it brought
not with it the joy, which (she fondly
hoped) would accompany her husband’s
arrival.</p>

<p class='c018'>Reports which agitate the great
world, are slow in reaching the dwellings
of retirement; yet there are <i>some</i>
transactions, which fame spreads about
with the rapidity of lightning, because
they are strange and terrible enough to
attract the attention of the universal
globe.</p>

<p class='c018'>Who trembles not at hearing the
dreadful word, <i>Regicide</i>? the emperor
Albert was dead; he had fallen by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>hands of the unfortunate John of
Swabia and his friends! this dreadful
report had been long circulated in whispers
among the mountains, where Adelaide
had fixed her residence; it at first
obtained little credit, but with every
succeeding day it seemed to assume
more consistency.  It had not yet
reached the ears of Adelaide; but her
attendants saw, that it would be impossible
to keep it from her knowledge
much longer; the prudent Gertrude
therefore, as the person among them
to whom the others looked up with the
greatest deference, undertook to give
the invalid some insight into these
melancholy events; observing every
possible precaution, that might weaken
their effect, and carefully concealing the
share, which the Lord of the Beacon-Tower
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>was reported to have taken in
the business. Chance unfortunately
prevented her from executing her kind
intentions.</p>

<p class='c018'>One evening, Adelaide was sitting
with her child at her bosom near a
window, which commanded the spacious
court-yard. On a sudden a single
warrior rushed into the court on horseback.
Adelaide sprang from her seat
with a cry of joy, and flew towards the
portal.</p>

<p class='c018'>—“Whither would you go, lady?”
exclaimed Gertrude, and hastened to
follow her.</p>

<p class='c018'>But Adelaide was already in the
court, and before he had time to enter,
had placed her child on the bosom of
his father.</p>

<p class='c018'>Rodolpho kissed his baby and its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>mother, and then amidst the joyful
shouts of the domestics who crouded
round their master, he followed Adelaide
into the great castle-hall: there
was he received with renewed embraces,
with questions, blessings, wonderings,
and all the delightful confusion of unexpected
and overflowing joy.</p>

<p class='c018'>Rapture at clasping in her arms
the man, whom she had so long sighed
to see, and at a moment so unlooked-for,
prevented Adelaide from observing,
that the rapture was not mutual. The
eager prattling of affection concealed
from her, that she was the only speaker;
and many hours had elapsed, before she
was sufficiently recovered from the delirium
of her joy to ask the question—“Oh!
Rodolpho, why thus silent? why
thus pale?”—</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>It was not so long, before his attendants
had remarked this alteration in their
Lord’s appearance; and the alarming consternation
displayed in his countenance
seemed to confirm the reports to his
disadvantage, which for some time had
been so prevalent. The pleasure, with
which his arrival had inspired them at
first, soon vanished; and all drew back
with shuddering from the man, on
whose hands they fancied that they
could discover the stains of royal blood.</p>

<p class='c018'>—“What troubles you, my beloved?”
Adelaide at length demanded of her
husband, who sat with his eyes fixed
stedfastly on the earth, and seemed not
to hear her question; “answer me for
pity’s sake! what troubles you?”—</p>

<p class='c018'>—“Oh! nothing, nothing!” he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>exclaimed, then sprang up suddenly,
and advanced towards the window—“all
is as it should be; nothing has
happened but what <i>ought</i> to have happened.
It is only my foolish heart, that
cannot be persuaded to let me be at
rest.”—</p>

<p class='c018'>—“All has happened, that ought to
have happened?” repeated Adelaide,
whose anxiety became more painful
with every moment; “and what then
<i>has</i> happened?”—</p>

<p class='c018'>Rodolpho without answering her
question, remarked that night was coming
on; he then desired a domestic to
take good care, that all the gates were
well locked and barred, and ordered
that the portcullis should be let down
to guard the narrow path, whose steps
were hewn in the rock, and which was
the only avenue to the Castle.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>—“Dearest Rodolpho,” said Adelaide,
while she took his hand with
mingled tenderness and apprehension
“what need of these precautions? are
you not safe in the arms of love?
surely, we now have no enemies to
dread.”—</p>

<p class='c018'>—“Adelaide, while Albert lived, we
had but <i>one</i> enemy: now that he is no
more, his death has created a thousand
avengers, who wait with impatience for
an opportunity to destroy us!”—</p>

<p class='c018'>—“His death?” exclaimed Adelaide
in a tone expressing the utmost horror,
and betraying that she already guest
the misfortune, which she was soon to
hear confirmed; “is then the emperor
dead? alas! and by whom?”—</p>

<p class='c018'>Her husband gazed upon her with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>a gloomy frowning air, and without
replying prepared to quit the apartment.</p>

<p class='c018'>Adelaide followed him, detained him,
and in a voice scarcely audible repeated
her question.</p>

<p class='c018'>Rodolpho bent himself towards her,
and whispered somewhat in her ear; yet
not so gently, but that Gertrude (who
was the only person then present) could
distinguish the emperor’s name, the
Duke of Swabia’s, and Rodolpho’s
own.</p>

<p class='c018'>—“Now then” said he, with a
loud voice and terrible look; “Now
then is Adelaide aware, by what name
she must henceforth greet her husband?”—</p>

<p class='c018'>It is easy to guess, how violent an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>effect this dreadful explanation must
have made upon the criminal’s unfortunate
wife! life is subject to moments,
in which a single word is sufficient to
bring at once before the mind the
whole wide extent of our future fate;
in which with a single look and in a
single feeling we embrace the whole;
and (be they of sorrow or be they of
joy) in which man’s feeble nature is
compelled to sink beneath the gigantic
strength of his sensations.</p>

<p class='c018'>Adelaide lay at her husband’s feet
deprived of animation. His caresses
and the care of her attendants only
awakened her to the sense of suffering.
It is true, the total deprivation of her
intellects for a time preserved her mind
from feeling the wretchedness of her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>situation; but her health was cruelly
affected by the violent attacks of a
malady, which soon brought her to the
very brink of the grave.</p>

<p class='c018'>Many months past before she was
pronounced out of danger; it required
no less a period to elapse, before she was
able to accustom her mind sufficiently
to seeing all her gloomy apprehensions
justified, without relapsing into that
melancholy state from which she had
just escaped with so much difficulty.</p>

<p class='c018'>While Rodolpho through his wife’s
illness suffered both for himself and for
her, his situation had become more
critical with every day. The favourable
hour for flight had been consumed by
the side of Adelaide’s sick-bed. With
no kind friendly hand to pour balm
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>into the wounds of his conscience, their
agony was become most acute; and he
was now compelled to see (what is
seen by every criminal) the deed that
was done with very different eyes from
those, with which he saw the deed
while it was yet to do. He was without
comfort, without hope; and already
did the emperor’s avengers tread close
upon his footsteps.</p>

<p class='c018'>There was no longer any security for
the unfortunate family of Rodolpho at
Ravenstein Castle: concealment was the
only chance for preserving his life from
the many swords, that were in search
of him. Adelaide’s first care therefore
on her recovery was to quit her abode;
nor did her still weak state of health
deter her from immediately executing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>her resolution. Rodolpho followed
whither she thought proper to conduct
him, less from the hope of saving his
wretched existence, than from feeling
it impossible to part any more from
Adelaide. The horror, which had taken
possession of all her faculties on first
hearing of this dreadful act, had now
given place to sorrow and compassion:
she tortured herself to find some apology
for his crime; and when she felt that
the excuses of love avail nothing at any
judgment-bar except its own, though
she found herself compelled to confess
Rodolpho guilty, she still vowed, that all
guilty as he was she loved him still, and
that all guilty as he was she would
perish with him.</p>

<p class='c018'>Willingly did the grateful inhabitants
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>of the Vale of Frutiger afford a shelter
to her, from whom they had formerly
received such essential services; but it
was not without much secret murmuring,
that they granted the same favour
to her blood-polluted husband. How
indeed could that innocent and open-hearted
race of people willingly support
the presence of a murderer?</p>

<p class='c018'>In the shelter of their huts Rodolpho
ran no risque of being betrayed; but
it was clear to every one, and most so
to himself, that the sacrifice made by
them in this instance to humanity, was
a sacrifice which cost them very dearly.
His own afflicted conscience too prevented
him from long remaining quiet
in the same place; and he at length
suddenly told his wife, that he was determined
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>on hastening to Rome, and
on soliciting absolution for his crime
at the feet of the holy father. This, he
believed, was the only balsam capable of
calming the inexpressible anguish, which
preyed upon his heart.</p>

<p class='c018'>Unwillingly did Adelaide suffer him
to tear himself from her arms. She
would fain have accompanied him in
his pilgrimage; but her weakness which
still continued, and the caution which
it was necessary for a proscribed man
to observe upon his journey, compelled
her to give up her generous design.
Rodolpho set forward in disguise for
Rome; Adelaide remained in the Vale
of Frutiger with her little son, mingling
the milk, which she gave him, with
many a tear of bitterness.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>A considerable space of time elapsed,
and yet no news arrived from the unfortunate
pilgrim: her friends the
worthy matrons of Helvetia endeavoured
to give this delay, which so
justly was the cause of much anxiety to
Adelaide, a favourable interpretation;
and their husbands solemnly promised,
should Rodolpho return with the Holy
Father’s pardon, they would refuse him
no service, which an honest man could
require at their hands.</p>

<p class='c018'>Adelaide’s tranquillity began to return:
absolution even from crimes, whose
mention makes humanity shudder, is
no uncommon thing in our days; this
is a circumstance, which gives the laity
opportunities of throwing much reproach
upon the church; but on which,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>as belonging to a religious society, it
becomes <i>me</i> to remain silent—the hopes
of our friend were also greatly strengthened
by an event, which (when Adelaide
communicated it in one of her letters)
appeared even to myself as meriting
no slight attention; it was, that persons
of inferior consequence having all desisted
from the pursuit, the only person,
who still demanded Rodolpho’s punishment,
was Johanna, the reigning queen
of Hungary, and daughter of the murdered
emperor. We trusted, that the
gentle soul of a woman would be easily
awakened to compassion; and this flattering
persuasion received additional
force, when Adelaide received an assurance,
that it was unnecessary for her to
continue in concealment, and that she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>might return to her abode at Ravenstein,
in perfect security from meeting
with injury or insult.</p>

<p class='c018'>Adelaide and her friends naturally
considered, this permission as a fore-runner
of still greater favours—“It is
clear then,” said she, “that the place of
my concealment was well known to
my husband’s enemies. It was in their
power, had they thought fit to take the
most severe vengeance, to have punished
Rodolpho’s crime on me and on his
son; but they molested us not, and I
am now permitted to return to my
former residence. Besides, Rodolpho
is in truth not so <i>very</i> culpable; he was
seduced into guilt by the artifice of
others. He drew not his sword to
revenge his own injuries, but to protect
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>his friend against injustice and oppression.
Perhaps he was selected as an
instrument of the Divine Vengeance, and
commissioned by Heaven to punish
Albert’s crime, who was himself his
sovereign’s murderer.”—</p>

<p class='c018'>Oh! Adelaide, how could your pure
and generous heart persuade itself even
in a single thought or by a single word
to palliate an offence, too atrocious to
admit of pardon? vainly did you strive
to deceive yourself; one serious glance
falling on the veil, which affection would
fain have thrown over the crime of
your beloved, was frequently enough
to make you tremble and blush at being
employed in such an office.</p>

<p class='c018'>For some time the Lady of the Beacon-Tower
resided at Ravenstein in a situation,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>whose apparent tranquillity was
more artificial than real, but which still
was rendered supportable by the hope
of better days. A thunder-clap suddenly
rouzed her from her pleasing
dreams, and a tempest hurried her
towards the termination of her sorrows.</p>

<p class='c018'>Every attempt to obtain intelligence
of the guilty wanderer had hitherto
been unsuccessful. Adelaide’s messengers
returned not; Rodolpho was unable
to dispatch messengers in return,
for he had no sooner set his foot within
the precincts of the Vatican, than he
was delivered into the hands of avenging
justice. What was his present fate,
and what would be that which was
still reserved for him, was already well-known
to every one in the neighbourhood
of Ravenstein. Concealed from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>her by the cruel tenderness of her attendants,
her husband’s situation was a
secret to Adelaide alone. Surely it was
cruel to hide from her an event, which
she could not escape knowing in the
end, till the whole consciousness of her
misfortunes burst upon her at once, and
with the violence of the shock crushed
her.</p>

<p class='c018'>The Lady of the Beacon-Tower entertained
no apprehensions for herself;
happen what would, she believed her own
person to be safe. The inhabitants of the
Helvetian mountains, in which she resided,
had been long dissatisfied with the
government of princes, who only employed
their power to rob them of their liberty;
and they had secretly resolved to
seize the first opportunity of breaking
their chains. They were prepared to run
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>every hazard in defence of their adored
Adelaide; and they counted it unnecessary
to warn her of the approach of
dangers, which they were firmly determined
to prevent from ever reaching
her. But where are the mountains so
inaccessible, the protection so powerful,
and the valour so impossible to be
subdued, that calamity cannot overcome
all obstacles in pursuit of her
destined victim!</p>

<p class='c018'>Johanna, the Queen of Hungary, who
with the fury of a tigress burned to
revenge her father’s death, demanded
admission into these tranquil vallies,
whose inhabitants, from their having
granted Rodolpho a temporary asylum,
she considered as adherents to the guilty
Duke of Swabia. One fortress after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>another fell into her power: she became
mistress by degrees of the whole
country; and at length Adelaide heard
the sound of hostile trumpets, ere she
had yet been made aware, that the most
revengeful of all women had penetrated
into Helvetia.</p>

<p class='c018'>Johanna’s mildness towards the murderer’s
family had been only assumed,
in hopes of discovering where Rodolpho
himself was concealed. His seizure had
rendered further artifice unnecessary, and
she was now permitted to show the violence
of her resentment without disguise.
She led her troops in person against
Ravenstein. Though lately repaired
and internally fitted up with elegance
and splendour, the fortress no longer
possest those strong means of defence,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>which in its antient state had enabled
it to set the attacks of foes so often at
defiance. Walter Forest, however, had
engaged to undertake the command of
it; but at the time when Johanna unexpectedly
appeared before the Castle,
this brave man was detained by patriotic
duties in a distant part of the country.
The garrison were capable of making
but a sorry resistance; the gates were
thrown open; and Johanna made her
triumphal entrance into Ravenstein
over the bleeding corses of those, who
had fallen the innocent victims of her
thirst for vengeance.</p>

<p class='c018'>Oh! Urania, I know well, that justice
required the punishment of Albert’s
murderers; I know well, that it was the
remembrance of her father’s death,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>which transformed his daughter into a
Feind; but still ... still I feel it
impossible for me without horror and
disgust to unite a thirst for blood with
the name of woman. Johanna, that
Saint-like princess, that builder of cloisters,
that worker of miracles; that
young and beautiful Johanna who, as
’tis whispered, is secretly by no means
averse to the tender passions; even
that very Johanna pursued her way
over heaps of mutilated corses, and said
with a triumphant smile to those who
followed her,—“that it seemed, as
if her path had been strown with
roses.”—</p>

<p class='c018'>The doors of the Great Hall were
thrown open; Adelaide lay senseless in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>the arms of her attendants. She was
half stretched across the cradle of her
sleeping child, as if even in the moment
of swooning she had still been aware,
that enemies were approaching too
pityless to spare even slumbering innocence.</p>

<p class='c018'>The pale countenance of the Lady of
the Beacon-Tower, the beauty of whose
features even sorrow had not been able
to destroy, and the helplessness of whose
present situation served only to render
her more interesting, would have touched
even the hearts of dæmons with
compassion; but on the incensed Johanna
this very beauty produced quite
a contrary effect. In the eyes of her
who gladly would have seen all other
charms eclipsed by her own, to be as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>lovely as Adelaide in itself was a crime
of no inconsiderable magnitude: nor
could the queen observe without extreme
displeasure, that among the
warriors in her train, many an eye
(whose approbation she would gladly
have engrossed entirely) dwelt with
looks of tenderness and admiration on
the fair lifeless statue, which lay extended
in the dust, overthrown by fear
and sorrow.</p>

<p class='c018'>—“Who is this woman?” demanded
the queen.</p>

<p class='c018'>—“Adelaide, Lady of the Beacon-Tower.”—</p>

<p class='c018'>—“Ha! say’st thou? the Regicide’s
wife then?—and yonder brat in the
cradle?”—</p>

<p class='c018'>—“It is Adelaide’s only son,” exclaimed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>Gertrude, at the same time
throwing herself at the feet of the Fury,
whose arm was already extended towards
the slumbering infant, as it lay
half-concealed by its mother’s robe.—“Mercy,
mercy for the poor babe; he
has been guilty of no crime; be satisfied
with revenging yourself on his
unfortunate father!”—</p>

<p class='c018'>A scream uttered by the little Rodolpho
rouzed his mother from her insensibility;
she looked up; she saw her
baby in the arms of the furious queen,
who childless herself and unworthy to
have children, knew not and cared not,
how such tender creatures should be
handled.</p>

<p class='c018'>Gertrude had quitted her kneeling
attitude, to hasten to the assistance of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>her awakening friend, who now took
the place which she had left unoccupied,
and embraced in Gertrude’s stead
the knees of the queen.</p>

<p class='c018'>—“My child!” she exclaimed;
“give me my child! what would you
do with it? why do you grasp it so
rudely? oh! it is tender, and you will
kill it! you will kill it!”—</p>

<p class='c018'>—“What would I do with it?” repeated
the implacable Johanna; “I
would dash the little serpent against the
ground, that it may not grow up to be
a regicide like its father!”—</p>

<p class='c018'>—“Oh! mercy! mercy! what crime can
the innocent babe have committed?”—</p>

<p class='c018'>—“None, lady, none,” replied Johanna,
while she cast upon the suppliant
a look of mingled anger and disdain;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>“’tis out of mere compassion, that I
use your infant thus. Had your husband
the regicide been treated in his
cradle as I will soon treat this screaming
worm, he had not been at this moment
on his road to the place of execution,
where he must soon end his guilty life
upon the rack.”—</p>

<p class='c018'>—“Say you?—my husband ...
the place of execution ... the rack too
... my child! oh! God, my poor child!”—thus
shrieked Adelaide, who had now
sprang from the earth, and was endeavouring
to force her infant from the
grasp of this female Dæmon; but her
exertions were too feeble, and she again
sank insensible upon the pavement.</p>

<p class='c018'>—“Lady,” exclaimed one of the
warriors, who seemed to be of most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>distinction among her attendants, “you
forget your sex!”—at the same time he
forcibly rescued the crying baby from
her hands, and placed it on the bosom
of Gertrude.</p>

<p class='c018'>This bold protector of innocence
must have possest no trifling influence
with Johanna, since she dared only
punish his action by an angry frown,
and immediately commanded (probably
through fear of his making still further
use of his power over her) that the
still fainting Adelaide should be removed
from her presence.</p>

<p class='c018'>The poor sufferer was conveyed to
one of those dungeons, with which you,
unfortunate Urania, are but too well
acquainted; Dungeons, whose massy
walls had rendered them impenetrable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>to the flames, which had laid all above
them in ruins. But what fortress is so
strong, what abyss of the earth is so
deep, that its approach is inaccessible to
the generous activity of friendship?
Gertrude had no sooner clasped in her
arms the poor ill-treated babe, than she
lost not a moment before she quitted
the Castle, and fled with him to implore
the honest inhabitants of the vale to
afford their assistance to his unfortunate
mother.</p>

<p class='c018'>As more than half the attendants of
the barbarous Queen of Hungary disapproved
of her late treatment of the
wretched and the helpless, and were
favourable to the cause of opprest innocence,
Gertrude met with but little
difficulty (when she secretly returned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>to Ravenstein) in gaining admission to
the dungeon of her friend: but she
found the unfortunate in a situation,
which made her escape almost impracticable—the
Queen had that morning
condescended to enter her cell, possibly
thinking that it was right to fulfill one of
the most sacred duties of her faith,
the visiting the prisoner: but what
she brought with her was not, according
to the divine precept, hope and
consolation. No; much rather was it
her business to heap on the head of her
heart-broken captive an additional
weight of motives for affliction. An
animated picture of the enormity of
Rodolpho’s crimes, and an horrible
enumeration of the tortures to which
his sentence condemned him, nearly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>robbed the wretched Adelaide of her
senses; and she only retained recollection
sufficient to feel the last stab inflicted
by her tormentor, when the
unfeeling woman named the day, on
which Rodolpho was to suffer. Well
did she hear that cruel word, and that
moment of horror inscribed itself on
her bewildered brain in characters of
fire.</p>

<p class='c018'>Gertrude, when she hastened to her
friend’s bedside, could not help fancying
that she already embraced her corse:
her feelings had been strained beyond
their utmost boundaries, and were
followed by a total cessation of her
powers both of body and of mind.</p>

<p class='c018'>Gertrude had received some plain
hints, that the compassionate servants of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>an inhuman mistress were disposed to
shut their eyes to any thing, which
she might undertake in favour of the
captive. Walter Forest’s mother had
accompanied her to Ravenstein; these
two kind-hearted women raised the unconscious
Adelaide in their arms, and
not without much difficulty conveyed
her from the dungeon. The guards
appointed to watch the door appeared
to be buried in sleep, while the fugitives
past them; and they reached a narrow
portal in the back part of the fortress
without meeting any impediment. The
good porter turned the lock for them
in silence, and (conscious that the veil
of darkness would conceal his benevolent
action from the queen, who would
not easily have been persuaded to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>pardon it), he assisted Gertrude to place
her rescued friend in the litter, which
waited for them at a few paces from
the Castle-gate. Swiftly did they now
descend the mountain-pass, and it was
not long, before the Castle of Ravenstein
was left far behind them.</p>

<p class='c018'>The good peasants, to whom Gertrude
applied for shelter and concealment,
granted it without hesitation: but many
days elapsed, before they succeeded in
snatching Adelaide from the shadows
of the grave, towards which her unbroken
stupor appeared to be conducting
her. On the fourth day, she discovered
the first symptoms of consciousness;
she started up suddenly, and asked
several hurried questions, which were
faithfully answered.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>Adelaide again sank back upon her
couch, and remained for some time
silent, with her eyes staring wildly, and
directed towards Heaven.</p>

<p class='c018'>—“Then it was not a dream!” she
said at length aloud; “it was not in a
vision, that I saw those dreadful scenes
at Ravenstein! it was but yesterday,
that all this happened, and yet it seems
to me, as if since then there had past
half a century!”—</p>

<p class='c018'>—“Pardon me, noble Lady. It is
now three days, since you have been in
safety: to-day is the first Monday after
the Nativity, and....”—</p>

<p class='c018'>—“Monday, say’st thou? the first
Monday after ... Rodolpho! oh!
Rodolpho!”—</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>She attempted to quit her bed, but
Gertrude prevented her.</p>

<p class='c018'>—“Dear Lady,” said she, “recollect
your weak condition: the sudden chill
or the morning-air would be enough to
kill you.”—</p>

<p class='c018'>—“Right, right! then it is only
morning yet? oh! yes; I now see myself
that it is no more. Look, where
the sun rises from behind yonder mountain!
ha! how red and how gloomy
he burns, foreboding that it will be a
bloody day!”—</p>

<p class='c018'>Gertrude comprehended not her
meaning, and replied not. Adelaide repeated
her request that she might be
permitted to rise, with such earnestness
that her attendants were compelled to
obey her. She suddenly drew her arm
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>from Gertrude’s, and walked a few
paces without assistance.</p>

<p class='c018'>—“Yes, it will do well,” said she, after
a pause with a look of satisfaction. “Now
then bring my child; let me once again
embrace him.—But alas! it must not
be. My boy is very young, and needs
much attention; even in your hands,
good Gertrude, he will not be taken
sufficient care of, and I must remain
here. Oh! my poor husband, I am
forbid to follow you; but peace, peace
to your tortured bones; repose and
pardon to your afflicted spirit!”——</p>

<p class='c018'>Adelaide with folded hands had sunk
on her knees before the cottage-window,
whose casement was illuminated by the
beams of the morning sun. She now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>rose up, and again demanded, that her
baby should be brought to her.</p>

<p class='c018'>Her attendants delayed to obey the
order. That delay alarmed her; she
insisted with increased earnestness on
seeing her child, and they were at last
compelled to acknowledge, that on the
evening before it had expired.</p>

<p class='c018'>—“Dead!” she exclaimed, and the
tone in which she spoke it exprest by
that single word at once all the feelings
of agony, which a mother’s heart can
suffer.—“Dead!” she again repeated,
after some moments of silence. Then
as if she had suddenly discovered a ray
of comfort, she added—“that is right!
quite right!—but still I must see it!—my
child! show me my child!”—</p>

<p class='c018'>They conducted her to the cradle, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>which the pallid infant lay, and appeared
to smile even in death. She kist it
without shedding a single tear, and
desired to be conducted back to her
couch, and to be left alone.</p>

<p class='c018'>Gertrude was too much on her guard
to grant the sufferer more than the first
half of her request. She seated herself
by her bedside, and for some time
watched unremittingly.—But wearied
with her long vigils during Adelaide’s
insensibility, she at length found her
powers inadequate to fulfill her good
intentions. About midnight sleep completely
overcame her; and now was an
opportunity afforded to the wife of my
unfortunate brother, to execute that
wild resolution whose consequences soon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>re-united her to the husband whom she
adored.</p>

<p class='c018'>Adelaide rose silently from her bed,
and left the house without being observed.
Through the shadows of night
she wandered towards the place, where
her broken heart panted to arrive. Her
weakness made her long in accomplishing
this painful journey. On the day
before her arrival Rodolpho had already
undergone the torture of the rack; yet
did Adelaide reach the place of execution
time enough to receive his last
breath and his last blessing. His breaking
eyes recognized her well-known
features, before they closed for ever;
he murmured her name, and she sank
upon his bleeding bosom<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c020'><sup>[1]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c021'><span class='label'><a href='#r1'>1</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Some historians assert, that the sufferings
of Rodolpho of the Beacon-Tower lasted for
three whole days.  During this time his wife
could not be persuaded to quit the place of execution,
and it was not till he had breathed his
last, that she suffered herself to be conveyed to
Basle, where she soon after expired.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>They forcibly removed her from the
scaffold; whether out of cruelty or
compassion I cannot pretend to say.
Understanding how closely I was connected
with her, the new Emperor
Henry of Luxemburg caused her to be
removed to my convent, that she might
end her days in my arms. God be
thanked, they were ended soon! death
and eternal rest were all, that it was
left us to wish the poor sufferer.
Scarcely had she strength to reach the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>place of my abode. The lay-sister informed
me that a lady ill and weary
requested to see me. I hastened to the
convent-gate; it was Adelaide. Wearied
in truth she was, alas! wearied even
unto death! it was on my bosom, that
the angel breathed her last.</p>

<p class='c018'>All-merciful Heaven, was not the
burthen then imposed on me too great
for the strength of one like me, a poor
weak helpless mortal? the bloody death
of my beloved though guilty brother
was scarcely announced, when I was
doomed to weep over the grave of that
innocent creature, whom I called my
sister not more with my lips, than with
my whole full heart!</p>

<p class='c018'>Adelaide was herself unable to explain
to me the connection of those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>terrible events, which cost her her existence:
but it was easy to guess those
which had happened lately. Her poor
wounded feet convinced me, that she
had performed some long and painful
journey, and whither could the wife
have directed her steps but to the scaffold,
on which her husband was condemned
to breathe his last? Poor,
poor Adelaide! the attempt to throw
yourself into my arms was the last exertion
of your exhausted powers: words
were denied you to explain your excess
of suffering to your sister; but
your looks so expressive of anguish and
pious resignation spoke to my heart in
a language most intelligible!</p>

<p class='c018'>Adelaide’s attendants had mist her soon
after her escape, and hastened in pursuit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>of her: but ignorance of the way
which she had taken for some time led
them astray. At length the report of
Rodolpho’s death reached them, and
gave them a clue to trace the fugitive.
From the place of execution it was easy
to follow her to my convent; where
else could they expect to find the unhappy
Adelaide, but in the arms of
sisterly affection?</p>

<p class='c018'>I learned such circumstances as
were still unknown to me from these
afflicted women, who were almost distracted
at hearing the loss of their
mistress, whose sudden death they attributed
to their own carelessness in
suffering her to escape. Not long after
these melancholy events, the <i>gentle</i> and
pious Queen of Hungary sent to request
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>that the body of the noble sufferer
might be delivered up to her messengers;
it being (as they informed me)
her intention to deposit it in her newly-erected
church of Konigfeld, which she
had built on the spot where her father
Albert had perished, and in which she
had already ordered a sumptuous
monument to be prepared for the Lady
of the Beacon-Tower.</p>

<p class='c018'>Report was loud in praise of this
generous act of the saint-like Johanna,
who thus offered an honourable grave
to the wife of her father’s murderer.
As it appeared to me in a light by no
means so amiable, I scrupled not to
give the Queen’s request a positive refusal.
My sister’s bones repose in the
vaults beneath our convent-chapel; the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>marble which covers them bears no inscription
except the name of her who
is buried there, a name which will be
sacred to the latest posterity, as an example
of undeserved affliction and of
love and truth unequalled.</p>

<p class='c018'>Come to this place of sorrow, dearest
Urania; come, and bathe that hallowed
stone with your tears, on which my
own still fall in my most serious hours.
At present suffer me to rest from the
painful task of describing scenes, the
slightest recollection of which is almost
sufficient to break my heart in pieces.
God grant that ere long it may break
for ever! Adelaide’s smiling form seems
to beckon me away to the regions of
light.—Rodolpho’s shade I strive in
vain to discern; it appears not!—oh!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>thou my brother! my dear seduced
unhappy brother! may the Divine Providence
grant me not to close my eyes,
till my unceasing fervent prayers shall
have obtained the absolution of thy
sins, and have gained thy admission into
the dwellings of the blessed!</p>

<h3 class='c016'><i>Emmeline of Sargans to Amabel Melthal.</i></h3>
<p class='c017'>Perhaps, dear Amabel, you had good
reasons for quitting the Castle of
Sargans, though filial respect forbids my
examining what those reasons were;
but have not I reasons equally good for
lamenting your departure? oh! never
more term me your mistress; that name

never treated you as really filling that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>station, to which you were destined,
when in the days of our childhood my
father first brought you with him to
Sargans. You were not my attendant;

the daughter of Henric Melthal, the
relation of Walter Forest and the pupil
of Gertrude Bernsdorf, has far greater
cause to be proud of her origin, than
one who is the offspring of Donat and
Mellusina, and who must blush to name
as her grandfather Ethelbert of Carlsheim,
the unfortunate and the guilty.</p>

<p class='c018'>Yet take comfort, Emmeline of Sargans!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>you too can number some few
among the connections of your family,
who would not disgrace the best and
proudest. The venerable Urania Venosta
deigns to bestow on you the names of
daughter and of grand-child; what
matters it, that her blood does not
actually flow in my veins, since her
heart feels towards me the affection of
a mother?</p>

<p class='c018'>Never can I prize too highly my good
fortune in having gained an interest in
the bosom of this admirable matron,
and being occasionally permitted to profit
by her intercourse!</p>

<p class='c018'>For this too am I indebted to <i>you</i>, my
Amabel! its true, I can still remember
well to have seen her in this Castle,
while I was yet but a child; I remember
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>well, that she bestowed on me the most
affectionate appellations, that she suffered
me to repose in her arms, and
that when she quitted Sargans, I wept
bitterly, and begged, that I might accompany
her. But the harshness with
which my father repulsed my dear
lost sister and myself, whenever we
ventured to express a wish that we
might see Urania once more, aided by
the lapse of years and the volatility of
youth, had by degrees nearly effaced all
recollection of her; when you, my
beloved friend, arrived at the Castle,
and recalled to my mind the noble
image of Urania. You boasted, that
you had resided for some time under
her protection, and that she had taken
the greatest pains to instill into your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>young mind lessons of the purest virtue,
in order that you might impart them
to the two poor orphan sisters, when
your father should conduct you to
Count Donat’s fortress; a step, to which
nothing less powerful than Urania’s
influence could have induced Henric
Melthal to consent.</p>

<p class='c018'>That step was the preservation of
Amalberga and of myself. Orphans in
truth we were! brought up under the
tuition of such a father, and associating
with his abandoned intimates, what was
it probable would become of us? Heaven
be thanked, you have saved us, or at
least you have saved <i>me</i>. But you are
torn from me; and now that you are
gone, how difficult should I have found
it to remain steady in the way that I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>ought to pursue, had you not shown
me the secret path through the wood
which terminates at Urania’s convent.
I have already frequently eluded the
vigilance of my attendants; I have
visited Urania; have always found the
doors of her cell open to me, and methinks
have never returned, without
feeling myself happier and better than
when I came.</p>

<p class='c018'>And all this do I owe to you, and yet
in writing to your friend Emmeline,
can you resolve to offend her by calling
yourself her servant? Amabel, you are
my benefactress; while I exist, never
will I cease to thank you.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>
  <h3 class='c016'><i>Emmeline of Sargans to Amabel.</i></h3>
</div>
<p class='c017'>I have just left the venerable Urania,
but I have received in her society to-day
less satisfaction than usual. I have
gone through a strict examination.
Though, Heaven be thanked, my heart
is unconscious of harbouring any thing
which I should blush to own, yet I
could not help feeling, that such close
enquiries were painful to me, and that
it was impossible for me to answer
every question with equal readiness.
Explain to me, Amabel, what was the
cause of these sensations; you are
more intelligent than I am, and have
frequently set me right, while I have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>been bewildered among the secret avenues
of my heart. Who was it but
Amabel, who first taught me to look
into myself, and to sit in severe and
impartial judgment over my own
thoughts and feelings?</p>

<p class='c018'>Urania during my former visits had
thought proper to enquire, how far I am
acquainted with the annals of my family.
I did not conceal from her, that Gertrude
Bernsdorf during the short visit
which Count Donat suffered me to pay
you in the Vale of Frutiger, had made
known to us every thing, of which
during fifty years she had been an eyewitness.
Urania blames highly the good
old woman’s loquaciousness, and assures
me, that above half what I have heard
from her was only calculated to do me
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>harm. I can well believe, that Urania
is in the right; it is at least certain,
that Gertrude’s narrative had almost
robbed me of one virtue, respect for the
character of my father; how can I
love and esteem that cruel Donat, who
was the author of all those complicated
misfortunes, which afflicted so many of
the best of earthly beings, and my admirable
friend Urania among the rest?
the benevolent saint chides me for encouraging
such thoughts, and bids me
forget that, which she has herself long
since forgotten; but how is it possible
for me to obey her? alas! I have
already been myself too severely the
victim of Count Donat’s vices. I cannot
forget that he abandoned my youth
to the ill impressions of his low-born
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>and libertine associates; that he degraded
me to be the companion of his
Parasites and his harlots: I cannot
forget, that it is he and his harsh treatment
of her, that I must thank for the
loss of my beloved Amalberga!</p>

<p class='c018'>The subject of Urania’s next question
regarded the fate of my sister: on this
point also I answered her with openness.
I did not merely relate those melancholy
scenes, which never can be effaced from
my memory; I painted them with such
warmth and in such lively colours, that
the emotion with which my story was
heard convinced me, that I had made
them present to the eyes of my auditor.
Still was she not contented with merely
hearing me briefly recite those circumstances,
which made her mingle her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>tears with mine: she has desired
me to communicate to her in writing
all that has past in the most circumstantial
manner; and she flatters me
with the hope of her being able to
found such conjectures on this narrative,
as may be the source to me
of much future consolation, and may
even be the means of finally re-uniting
me to my dear lost sister.</p>

<p class='c018'>Oh! were I but certain, that this
would really be the consequence, with
what pleasure should I undertake a task,
which I shall now enter upon so unwillingly!
Amabel, you saw how many
tears I shed, when that unexpected and
most inexplicable event took place; and
you will not wonder, that sitting where
I now do, those tears flow with renewed
violence. It was in this very chamber,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>that I saw Amalberga for the last time!
what pain did it cost me to tear myself
away from her! in what distraction did
I fall at the feet of my cruel father, and
entreat him no longer to imprison my
beloved sister, or at least to make me
her companion in captivity! he repulsed
me with frowns; and the innocent girl
heard Count Donat’s own hand turn
the lock of this chamber, in which the
next morning she was no longer to be
found. My father and myself mutually
accused each other of her flight; <i>his</i>
accusations were curses, mine were
confined to tears: whether both were
equally innocent of Amalberga’s disappearing
is at least to me still a
mystery.</p>

<p class='c018'>And these events, which when even
slightly hinted at gave my heart a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>severe pang, must I compel myself to
commit to paper calmly and circumstantially!—yet
be it so! the painful
task will cost me many tears, but they
will not be the first tears, which have
streamed within these walls. Urania
informs me, that this very chamber was
long her own; how severe were her
afflictions is already known to you.</p>

<p class='c018'>I now come to the third subject of
enquiry, with which (I might almost
say) my adopted mother <i>tortured</i> me
this morning; and I am scarcely less
unwilling to mention it even to you, than
I was unable to reply to <i>her</i> with firmness
and sincerity.</p>

<p class='c018'>You cannot have forgotten what
past at the tournament, at which I saw
the Bishop of Coira’s nephew for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>first time. Urania seems to be almost
as well acquainted as you and myself
with all that past on that occasion; and
were I not thoroughly convinced of the
discretion of my faithful Amabel, I
might be tempted to suspect her of
having incautiously suffered herself to
be seduced into revealing the secrets of
her friend.</p>

<p class='c018'>I was not so frank, as you might
possibly have been in a similar situation;
and my want of confidence in her drew
down upon me in some degree the
matron’s displeasure. I will endeavour
on a future occasion to repair my fault,
but I doubt being able to prevail on
myself to do so. It seems to me very
difficult, I might almost say quite impossible,
to lay before the eyes of a Nun
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>considerably advanced in years those
weaknesses, which she must have long
since forgotten and have learned to
despise and ridicule; even supposing,
that she should ever have been subject
to them in the same degree with myself.</p>

<p class='c018'>I flatter myself, that I deserve to be
forgiven, and that I should run no
risque in discovering my secret sentiments
even before the most severe
tribunal. Who could see Herman of
Werdenberg without emotion? neither
is it an object of slight importance, to
obtain by marriage my deliverance from
a family so constituted as Count Donat’s.
I am assured daily, that I might immediately
obtain that deliverance, would
I but insist upon being permitted to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>assume the veil; and heaven only knows,
what step I should not be ready to
take, rather than remain longer exposed
to such dangers as environ me at Sargans,
had I not hopes of being released
in a more agreeable manner, by the hand
of my beloved warrior. Do you think
it possible, my friend, that Herman
should persist in his obstinacy much
longer, when his only motive is grounded
on his aversion to my name, the
melancholy and hated name of <i>Count
Donat’s daughter</i>?</p>

<p class='c018'>It would be superfluous to describe
to you the mode of life at present
followed in the Castle of Sargans;
things go on in their old track. The
female favourites of the Count my
father resemble each other so nearly,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>that the change is scarcely perceptible,
when one Sultana retires, and a new
one commands in her place. Those
days, which I might otherwise pass in
tranquillity, while Count Donat with
his wild companions are ranging among
hills and forests in pursuit of game,
those days are now made almost insupportable,
thanks to the insolence of the
reigning mistress of the Castle. Besides
this, the boon companion of my father’s
riotous pleasures Abbot Luprian of
Cloister-Curwald, through impatience
for the return of the hunters, never
fails to make his appearance at the
Castle too soon; and then not knowing
how to dispose of his time, he thinks
proper to bestow it on me, a favour
with which I could most readily dispense.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>This man is odious to me
beyond measure: the ostentatious pomp
of his appearance continually reminds
me of that worthless Guiderius, who
made Urania pass so many uneasy hours.
Perhaps, my aversion to the Abbot is
merely founded on prejudice; God
grant, that I may not find cause to be
confirmed in my ill opinion.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>
  <h3 class='c016'><i>Amabel Melthal to Emmeline of Sargans.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c017'>It is not then necessary for me to
apologize, or to justify my secret departure
from her father’s Castle, before the
tribunal of Lady Emmeline: it seems,
she is already aware, that it was absolutely
necessary for me to tear myself
away from one who is most dear to me,
whether the name by which I call her
is that of mistress or of friend.—Oh!
would that my prayers could obtain
from Heaven, dear Emmeline, that the
many acts of kindness which you have
bestowed on me, might soon be rewarded
by your deliverance from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>snares, with which your virtue is now
surrounded; by your deliverance from
them through the affection of Count
Herman!</p>

<p class='c018'>Yet should you reach this utmost
aim of your wishes, I doubt much,
whether you would even then enjoy
such complete happiness, as is mine at
this moment. Fortune acts by the
great-ones of the earth much like a step-mother.
Their highest state of bliss
is seldom any thing better than splendid
captivity; and the pomp and state in
which they exist, the throng of shining
courtiers who wait upon their footsteps,
the necessity of sustaining the
dignity of their rank (an obligation,
which frequently weighs upon them
most heavily) all these are in fact absolute
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>fetters. We, more humble children
of the land, are acquainted with
no pomp except that of nature, which
appears to us ever new; no attendants
are ours, except such as inclination and
a similarity of tastes and feelings induce
to be the voluntary companions of our
steps; and no duties are imposed on
us but those which are most delightful
in the performance, domestic virtue and
love for the land to which we are
indebted for our birth.</p>

<p class='c018'>Oh! Lady, how earnestly do I wish
for your presence in these dwellings of
tranquillity! I deny not, that the vallies
in which your father’s lofty fortress
stands, are fair and fruitful; your castle
on the Rhine, whose walls are bathed
by that proud river flowing past them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>in calm majesty, is a noble and stately
mansion, and the shades of the Munster-Vale
remind me of those of Paradise:
but compared with the days
which I now pass in these calm and
happy habitations, believe me, the
pleasures of your more brilliant mode
of life appear but as mere shadows.</p>

<p class='c018'>Yet let us have patience! the spirit
of liberty will by degrees pervade every
quarter of the land, and then will every
quarter of the land be as happy, as that
which I inhabit. Even among <i>us</i>, there
are certain men (you will observe, that
I say <i>men</i>, for we women are ever more
easily satisfied with our condition than
that haughty sex) there are among us
some men, who in spite of all the freedom
which we enjoy still speak frequently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>of chains and task-masters, and
make loud complaints against the prevalence
of cruelty and oppression.
They call the emperor’s representatives
(one of whom is established in our
neighbourhood) by no gentler name
than that of tyrants; and they are by no
means pleased, when these powerful
lords condescend to honour us with
their intercourse, and to take a part in
our rural festivities.</p>

<p class='c018'>You know well, lady, that I am not
disposed to like the society of persons
of rank much superior to my own:
yet in justice to our newly arrived
governor, I must beg you not to imagine,
that the Lord of Landenberg in the
least resembles either a voluptuous
Abbot of Cloister-Curwald, or a fierce
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>and tyrannical Count Donat of Carlsheim.
No! he is a man, who unites
the agreeable polish of courtly manners
to the frank and generous heart of a
true Helvetian; he willingly adopts the
plain familiar tone, which prevails
among our retired mountains, and is
right in thinking, that it must be gratifying
to every one of us to obtain the
notice of a man of such peculiar merit
and who fills so distinguished a situation.</p>

<p class='c018'>In our part of the country a thousand
rural feasts are at present celebrating,
such as might be worthy of the
golden age. The most illustrious of
our people are assembled here from all
quarters; and the smile of joy and
bloom of health, which animate the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>countenances of these numerous pilgrims
of pleasure, make our society more gay
and brilliant, than is ever found to be
the case at the costly entertainments of
princes. Every thing is pleasing and
satisfactory, except that on the countenances
of some of the men (as I
before informed you) I can sometimes
discover the marks of secret discontent.
Among them I must reckon my father
and brother, Gertrude’s husband (Gertrude
herself was prevented by indisposition
from joining us) and Walter
Forest, who is lately arrived from the
Vale of Frutiger; of all these, not one
seems to receive the attentions and
kindness of our worthy governor with
as much gratitude, as his condescension
deserves. Its true, the numerous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>society at present collected in our
valley, and the festivities which are
every day taking place, are profest to
be in honour of the arrival of the emperor’s
new representative; but to me
it appears evident, that their intention
is less to show respect for him,
than to furnish an opportunity of
examining his behaviour, and of prying
into the secrets of his heart, when
thrown off his guard by gaiety and
pleasure.</p>

<p class='c018'>Methinks, lady, what I write is not
proper to be seen by every eye: but
the bearer of this letter is trusty; and
besides the characters of our pens are
to most of our cotemporaries inexplicable
riddles. The other day, when
we carried presents to the Castle, according
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>to custom on the arrival of
every new governor, the Lord of
Landenberg singled me from the croud
of girls of my own age, and enquired,
whether I was a native of these vallies.
On this my dear partial mother undertook
to answer for me; and in the
course of her speech she found means
to run over the list of my accomplishments
(as she fondly called them)
among which she enumerated the art
of writing. The governor looked
astonished, and acknowledged, that in
this respect he must give way to <i>me</i>
though a female; nor did he believe,
(he added) that among all his lay-attendants
there was one who knew how to
guide the pen, unless it were Wolfenrad,
his Seneschal.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>—“Here, Wolfenrad!” he continued,
motioning to him to advance; “this
pretty maid is Amabel Melthal, who I
am told is well instructed in the arts
of reading and writing. Were you
still unmarried, she would make a
proper wife for you, and both might
be of great use to me in my family
affairs.”—</p>

<p class='c018'>I blushed and retired hastily, and
concealed myself among my companions;
married or unmarried, Wolfenrad should
never be my choice—the conversation
too seemed to have taken a turn by no
means to the taste of our matrons, for
they lost no time in leading us back
from the Castle; and when Walter
Forest returned with my father and
brother from an excursion, which they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>had made among the eastern mountains,
they blamed the conduct of the matrons
in suffering the young Damsels to accompany
them on their visit to the
governor. My mother was censured
more than all the rest for not having
at least ordered <i>me</i> to remain behind;
for they say, that my education in the
convent of Zurich under the venerable
Urania, and the polish which my
manners acquired during my residence
at your father’s Castle, have
given me a kind of foreign air, which
distinguishes me from the rest of the girls,
and which in spite of my inferiority to
most of them in point of beauty, makes
it difficult for me to escape without
observation.</p>

<p class='c018'>I must now close this long epistle,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>by wishing you patience to endure
your present difficulties, and recommending
you to look forward to better
times, which I hope are at no great distance.</p>

  <h3 class='c016'><i>Emmeline of Sargans to Urania Venosta.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c017'>I once possest a beloved companion,
who was dear to me as myself; Amalberga
was her name. She was my
sister; but the bonds, which nature had
formed between us, were slight in comparison,
with those of affection; an affection
which I should have felt for her,
had I been a princess, and Amalberga
a peasant’s daughter. It seems to me
as if whole years had elapsed, since we
were separated; and yet all circumstances,
and particularly the unremitting
activity which is still exercised in
pursuit of the fugitive, combine to assure
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>me, that only a few months have
crept away since her disappearance.</p>

<p class='c018'>You desired, dear mother, to see the
history of the poor persecuted girls
traced by my pen; I now send you the
produce of several sleepless nights, for
the night is the only time which I am
permitted to call my own. I suspect,
you foresaw that the harshness of my
jailors would ere long interrupt my
personal intercourse with you, and that
this was the motive, which induced you
to advise my having recourse to my
pen.</p>

<p class='c018'>Count Donat suffered his daughters
to grow up under his roof in total
ignorance of what was owing to themselves
and to others. He believed, that
he had troubled himself about us quite
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>sufficiently in making us over to the
superintendance of a young governess,
whose beauty and whose levity were
her sole recommendations to favour.
It was clearly her interest totally to
neglect the heiresses of Carlsheim and
Sargans, in order that after our removal
from the world she might entirely
engross the attentions of our childless
father, a considerable portion of whose
inheritance she doubted not being able
to secure to herself.</p>

<p class='c018'>In what regarded our persons, this
neglect did us no detriment. In spite
of want and oppression of every kind,
the natural strength of our constitutions
carried us through all difficulties, and
we daily increased in bloom and stature:
but the health of our minds was seriously
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>shaken. No principles of virtue
were inculcated; no one explained to
us the difference between vice and
virtue; and surrounded as we were on
all sides by the worst examples, we
already began to contract the bad habits
of our despicable associates.</p>

<p class='c018'>Our father’s enemies were almost as
many, as there were noblemen whose
domains bordered upon his own. Not
one was there amongst their number,
who had not been offended by him
either personally or indirectly: but of
them all his most dangerous and deadly
foe was Count Lodowick of Homburg,
the husband of that Minna of Mayenfield,
for whom your history has taught
me to feel such unbounded love and
admiration.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>How then was it possible, after all
the bitter causes of complaint which
Minna alledged against Count Donat,
both on her own account, and on yours
and her mother’s; how was it possible,
that in spite of Donat’s unremitting
enmity of which he daily gave fresh
proofs, the noble Count of Homburg
should have condescended to sue for
peace at a time, when he was the
strongest; and that he should even
have confided so far in the honour of
his enemy, as to trust himself and his
lovely wife at the Castle of Sargans?</p>

<p class='c018'>In this transaction is not your hand
perceptible, Urania? oh! you had not
forgotten, that within those hated walls
were immured two forsaken children,
the destined victims of vice or of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>grave. Your benevolent proposal of
taking us under your care, which you
laid before our father in our earliest
childhood, was received by him in the
same manner, with which he treats every
thing tending to promote the interests of
virtue; those frequent attempts, which
you afterwards made to draw us within
the circle of your power, proved without
effect; and you now endeavoured
through your friend the Countess of
Homburg to snatch us from the precipice,
on whose brink we stood. I
am not unconscious, my kind protectress,
how many artifices were tried in
vain to entice us out of the precincts of
the Castle of Sargans; how often during
our childhood, now one emissary and
now another strove to rescue us by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>force from the dominion of our worthless
governess; how once the Retainers
of the Convent of Zurich had actually
succeeded in carrying us to some distance
from the Castle, before we were
overtaken and brought back to our
paternal prison; and how when Count
Donat complained of this outrage and
demanded satisfaction of the Bishop,
the good Priest returned him for answer,
that he would do better to send his
daughters of his own accord to be instructed
by the Nuns in piety and virtue,
than to retain them in the Castle of
Sargans in order that they might be educated
by his paramours, and become in
time as worthless as their instructors.
It is to you, dear mother, that we are
indebted for all these endeavours to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>rescue us from ruin, and the visit of
the Countess of Homburg was equally
your work.</p>

<p class='c018'>This interview between Count Lodowick
and my father possest the merit
of at least wearing the appearance of
friendly inclinations: whether it was
the means of inducing them to live on
better terms in future, than had hitherto
been the case, I cannot pretend to
decide: but it is certain, that the
Countess did not neglect the object,
which had induced her to enter once
more the hated Castle of Sargans.
Immediately on her arrival she requested,
that my sister and myself might form
the society of her daughter, whom she
had brought with her. Count Donat
could not in common decency refuse
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>her this mark of attention. Therefore
during the few weeks that Count
Lodowick’s family resided at Sargans,
we were seldom out of the company
of the Countess and her daughter, from
both of whom we received a thousand
undeserved testimonies of interest and
attachment.</p>

<p class='c018'>It was no slight sacrifice, which the
Countess made to gratitude and friendship,
when she suffered us to associate
so intimately with her well-educated
daughter: it was much to be feared,
that she would contract some of the
numerous failings, to which we had
been subjected by our neglected education.
But Helen of Homburg, though
she was younger than ourselves, ever
contrived to make us adopt her own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>proper mode of conduct, instead of
suffering herself to be drawn into
errors by our example.</p>

<p class='c018'>The mother of our young friend
was not contented with having planted
the seeds of morality and religion in
our hearts; she was anxious not to
give up her benevolent task, till she
had effected our total preservation.
She therefore proposed to take us entirely
under her superintendance, and
made her request in a tone and manner,
as if she had not the least doubt of its
being granted. But this very request
furnished our father with an opportunity
of breaking off with Count
Lodowick altogether, a step which he
had only been prevented from taking
sooner by the inconceivable generosity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>and forbearance of his illustrious
guest.</p>

<p class='c018'>Count Donat’s answer to the noble
Minna’s request was proud and insolent;
her rejoinder was conveyed in that
tone of delicate but cutting irony, which
is peculiar to herself. Her husband
commented on Count Donat’s uncourteous
behaviour with more warmth and
bitterness, than he is accustomed to
employ; and the consequence of this
conversation was a total rupture between
the two Counts, and the absolute overthrow
of that edifice, which they had
past so many days in raising.</p>

<p class='c018'>Without an hour’s delay did the
Count of Homburg quit Sargans; nor
would his journey home have been
unmolested, had he not been provident
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>enough, when he visited the fortress of
his antient foe, to bring with him a
retinue well-armed, and in number not
to be despised.</p>

<p class='c018'>I believe, that he would not have found
it impossible at that moment to have
carried us off with him: but even
though affection for the poor children
might have induced his lady to propose
such a step, undoubtedly the Count of
Homburg’s high notions of honour and
integrity would have made him recoil
with aversion from the idea of forcibly
taking his daughters from a man, into
whose Castle he had been received
under the appearance of friendship.</p>

<p class='c018'>Thus did we lose this invaluable chance
of preservation. It is true, we were still
too young to understand, that preservation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>was necessary; but yet we felt most
sensibly the pain of parting from the
Ladies of Homburg: nor did we feel
a little mortified at being replaced
under the care of the unworthy women
appointed to superintend us, whom
respect for our illustrious protectress
had compelled to keep in the background
during her residence at Count
Donat’s Castle.</p>

<p class='c018'>Yet though the Countess of Homburg’s
visit had failed in its grand object, it
was not without its use. We had past
two weeks in the habits of decorum;
we had learnt to see our own failings,
and to admire the advantages possest
by others; and this knowledge served
us as a regulator for our future behaviour.
The manners of Helen of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>Homburg became the model, by which
we formed our own: we were no longer
in danger of adopting the evil lessons
of our superintendents, for in the remembrance
of Helen we had constantly
before us a lively idea of feminine
delicacy and indeed of feminine perfection.</p>

<p class='c018'>Oh! Urania, unwearied discoverer of
new means to effect the happiness of
the two poor orphan-girls, I dare flatter
myself, that when the Angel arrived at
Sargans whom you sent thither (shortly
after the Count of Homburg’s visit) to
guide us to the paths of goodness, she
found that we had already advanced
some steps: at least it is certain, that
she found us willing and resolved to
follow, where she, and Urania, and
Virtue pointed out to us the way.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>Henric Melthal (one of my father’s
vassals, who had always shown too
little willingness to advance his evil
designs to be a favourite with his master)
one day brought his daughter to Sargans.
He entreated, that she might be
received into the service of the Count’s
daughters; and either his chusing a
moment when Donat fortunately happened
to be in an unusually good
humour, or satisfaction at finding the
stubborn Henric at length inclined to
perform willingly the duties of a vassal,
or perhaps the observing glance by
which he convinced himself that Amabel
would in time be beautiful, made Henric
easily obtain his demand.</p>

<p class='c018'>Amabel was accepted as our attendant;
she became our play-fellow, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>I may say, our best instructress. It was
you, who had educated the amiable
girl, doubtless with a view to your
adopted children; you know well, how
much service Amabel was capable of
rendering us, and (God be thanked
for it!) I trust, that her intercourse has
not totally been without effect.</p>

<p class='c018'>The well-grounded and solid information
possest by that dear girl, her firm
attachment to virtue, duty, and truth, and
the vast extent of her brilliant qualities,
all lay concealed beneath the modest
veil of rural simplicity, which hid from
every eye the treasure we possest in
her, and was for many years the means
of preserving to us so invaluable a
friend.</p>

<p class='c018'>We grew up with Amabel in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>closest intimacy; we even obtained
permission to accompany her in one of
her visits to her father, and there
became acquainted with an antient
friend of our family. It was Gertrude
Bernsdorf, who completed that part of
our education, which was too difficult
for the power of our young companion.
Our eyes were opened; we saw all the
dangers of our residence under Count
Donat’s roof in their true light. We
meditated an escape, whose object was
taking refuge with you in the Convent
of Zurich: but we were too well
guarded to effect our purpose. Its true,
no one suspected the open-hearted
Amabel of deceit; but still a variety of
attempts to carry us off had put our
father on his guard, and we were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>seldom suffered to quit the Castle without
attendants.</p>

<p class='c018'>I cannot persuade myself that it was
a sentiment of paternal affection, which
made the Count of Carlsheim so anxious
to preserve us under his roof. His
behaviour towards us left us no doubt,
that we might have perished without
our loss costing him a single tear; he
had also frequently given us to understand,
that he designed us for the
Convent: but still he could not resolve
to gratify those, who wished to take us
from him, by suffering them to succeed;
neither would he hear of our residing
in <i>that</i> Convent, where we should have
been so happily and so honourably
situated, under the protecting care of
the venerable Urania.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>Since you, dear mother, abandoned
the world, great alterations have taken
place in our neighbourhood, of which
you may not be aware: at least Gertrude
has assured me, that for ten miles round
the Castle of Sargans, every thing since
the days of her youth is become so
different, that she scarcely knows the
place to be the same. Like most
people when advanced in life, Gertrude
was accustomed to find great faults with
these changes: she hated the sight of
trees, which thirty years before she had
seen no higher than bushes; she sighed
to perceive, that the mountain-torrents
had washed away <i>this</i> hill at one time
and <i>that</i> at another; and she looked on
it as little better than profanation, when
she found buildings raised on places,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>which formerly were corn-fields or
pasture-land.</p>

<p class='c018'>But nothing was more offensive in
her eyes than a particular Convent for
females, which had been lately erected
at no great distance from the Abbey of
Cloister-Curwald; and which on account
of the extraordinary privileges
bestowed on it by the Holy Father, of
the beauty of its situation, and of the
advantageous manner in which its interior
constitution was regulated, had
grown rapidly into repute.</p>

<p class='c018'>Our father had pitched upon this
Convent for the future abode of Amalberga
and myself; perhaps, it was the
first time in our lives, that we had
found reason to be perfectly satisfied
with his decisions respecting us. We
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>were convinced, that our wish to inhabit
the same place with our benefactress
Urania would never be gratified;
with every day we felt more sensibly,
that any religious house whatever would
be a much more creditable abode for
us, than the Castle of Sargans. Besides,
the Convent of St. Roswitha (for the
Nuns belonged to that order, who had
established themselves in the neighbourhood
of Cloister-Curwald) possest the
charm of novelty, and our friend Amabel
had exprest her opinion in favour
of its establishment. In defiance therefore
of the prejudiced Gertrude’s warnings
and admonitions, we determined
(whenever Count Donat should seriously
advise our taking such a step) to
declare ourselves ready to assume the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>veil in that Convent, which he had
himself selected.</p>

<p class='c018'>There needed nothing more than
such implicit obedience to induce our
father to alter his intention. His early
intercourse with the worthless of both
sexes, his misanthropic seclusion from
all general society, and a glance thrown
by him upon the formation of his own
heart, had made him distrustful of
every one else. He suspected hidden
views in the most indifferent actions;
and he always suspected them most,
when he found others most disposed to
conform themselves to his wishes.</p>

<p class='c018'>Our departure for the Convent of
St. Roswitha, which (had we disapproved
of going) would undoubtedly
have taken place the next day,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>was now postponed; it was however
judged expedient for us to remove for
some time from Sargans, an hostile
attack being expected from one of his
neighbours, whose views (so Count
Donat imagined, though on what
grounds I know not) were directed towards
the persons of Amalberga and
myself.</p>

<p class='c018'>It happened just then, though it
happened but very seldom, that our
father was on good terms with the
Bishop of Coira. Count Herman of
Werdenberg, a relation of our family,
at that time filled this important office;
his court was selected as our place of
refuge from a danger, which only existed
in Count Donat’s imagination,
and the nature of which he would in all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>probability have been himself greatly
embarrassed to explain.</p>

<p class='c018'>We set out, accompanied by Amabel.
Our reverend relation received us with
that respect, which was due to our
station; I believe indeed, he allowed us
even a larger share of it, than we could
reasonably claim on the sole score of
our rank.</p>

<p class='c018'>His manner gave us confidence and
gaiety, and we soon became attached
to the kind-hearted Prelate. We were
in truth but simple country-girls, quite
unacquainted with the manners of the
great world, and only wise enough to
be sensible of our deficiency. Accustomed
to be treated with nothing but
severity, Count Herman’s gentleness
delighted us; and his protection encouraged
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>us to enter willingly into those
societies, where it was his pleasure that
we should be introduced.</p>

<p class='c018'>The Count of Werdenberg is quite a
different kind of person from his predecessors,
the old Bishops of Coira.
When I recollect the portraits of the
venerable Adelfried-Herbert, and of the
pious Thomas of Planta, such as I saw
them in your closet; and when I compare
their austere and mortified countenances
with that of the penetrating,
the polished, the gallant, the martial
Herman of Werdenberg; when too I
reflect how different their simple Priest’s
habit appeared from the glittering and
costly robes, in which our Cousin appeared
when we were unexpectedly
presented to him for the first time,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>though the day was not a festival; when
I think on all these things, my dear
mother, I can scarcely persuade myself,
that he and the originals of your pictures
ever have belonged to the same profession.</p>

<p class='c018'>The manners of the Bishop’s court
were entirely new to us, but were not
the less pleasing. Certainly, our father
must have been little aware of the
nature of the place, whither he had
sent us for shelter; or else it must have
been the most bitter hatred against his
daughters, which induced him to make
us first acquainted with the pleasures of
the world, in order that the recollection
of the enchanting scenes which
they were now witnessing, and the
hopeless desire of witnessing them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>again, might make the cloister for
which he destined them seem doubly
hateful.</p>

<p class='c018'>Everything here appeared new to
us; not merely the amusements which
offered themselves every day to our
enjoyment, but the discovery which
was made to us in a very few hours
after our arrival, that we were beautiful.</p>

<p class='c018'>—“Beautiful?” said I to Amalberga;
“How could it possibly happen, that
we should not have found this out long
ago?—It is true, I always thought, there
was something uncommonly pleasing
in your countenance, my dear sister;
but still your features were too much
like my own, for me ever to have suspected
them of being beautiful.”—</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>We consulted Amabel on this important
point. She assured us with that
simplicity which was natural to her,
that we did not appear beautiful to
<i>her</i>, for that on the banks of the Lake
of Thun (where she was born) the
blooming charms of the village damsels
were far superior to ours, at least as
far as she could give an opinion; a
confession, which we heard her make
without feeling the slightest displeasure.</p>

<p class='c018'>Perhaps in time we should have returned
to our former opinion of our
beauty, if we had heard them praised
by no one except the old Bishop, who
was the first to make the remark. But
among the young knights, whom the
love of Tilts and Tournaments had
collected at Count Herman’s court, there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>were many whose existence seemed to
hang upon our smiles, and who loaded
us with compliments which we not
only heard but too willingly, but even
began to consider as a tribute, which
ought not to be withheld from us with
impunity.</p>

<p class='c018'>Among the youthful warriors whom
a splendid Tournament had attracted
to the court of Coira, were two who
particularly attracted the attention of
my sister and myself; and it happened
to be precisely these two, who seemed
blind to that beauty, on which we had
now learnt to set so high a value. It
is true, Count Eginhart of Torrenburg,
to whom my sister gave the preference,
afforded us strong reasons for suspecting,
that he was not insensible of the power
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>of Amalberga’s charms; yet his attentions
to her were ever cold and constrained,
like those of one who had
already formed engagements, and had
only just discovered, that he had been
too hasty in making his choice.</p>

<p class='c018'>As for me, my situation was still
more unpleasant. The youthful Herman
of Werdenberg, the Bishop’s nephew,
had indeed paid me a few unmeaning
compliments on my arrival, before he
was informed of my name; but after
our first interview, he treated me with
utter neglect, and seized every excuse
for avoiding my society. Nay; he
carried his unjustifiable aversion so far,
that when on the evening before the
Tournament his Uncle gave him a scarf
of my colours, with a command to wear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>it at the next day’s solemnity, it was
not without difficulty, that he abstained
from insulting me (whom this unexpected
mark of the Bishop’s partiality
for me had covered with blushes) by
positively refusing to accept his gift.</p>

<p class='c018'>—“These are the colours of the
Lady Emmeline,” said the Bishop, “of
the future Heiress of Carlsheim and
Sargans. The permission to wear them
publicly, which I now give you in her
name, may authorize you to encourage
hopes, whose completion will not be
purchased too dearly with the most
precious blood that runs in your
veins.”——</p>

<p class='c018'>I attempted to express my disapprobation
of the Bishop’s inconsiderate
conduct, and to disclaim the permission
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>which he asserted me to have given;
but vexation choaked my utterance, and
I was obliged to quit the chamber,
unable longer to restrain my tears
from gushing.</p>

<p class='c018'>—“This is not to be endured!” I
said to myself, as I hastened to take
refuge in my own apartment. “Good
Heavens! then interest is the only
motive, which can persuade Herman to
connect his fate with that of Emmeline!
let her be as fair, as kind, as amiable as
she can be, Emmeline will still be
nothing in the eyes of Herman, but the
Heiress of Carlsheim and Sargans.—Alas!
poor slighted girl! hide yourself
to-morrow in your thickest veil,
nor let the public eye perceive the blush
of shame on your cheek, when every
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>one who sees Count Herman’s mail
decorated with the sky-blue scarf, will
cast on you a look of congratulation,
and believe that you are the most fortunate of your sex while
you are in fact the most wretched and despised.”—</p>

<p class='c018'>Much as it cost me, I resolved to
deny myself the satisfaction of witnessing
Count Herman’s exploits, and under
pretence of indisposition I absented
myself from the Tournament. My
sister alone distributed the prizes; but
Herman had gained the first, and according
to the regulations of the lists
he was under the necessity of laying it
at the feet of the lady, whose colours
he had thought proper to wear.</p>

<p class='c018'>I was compelled to go through this
painful scene, and to see him kneeling
before me: but it was evident, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>he performed his task with the utmost
reluctance; and his manner provoked
me to such a degree, that I could not
refrain from assuring him—“that I ascribed
no part of this compliment to my
own merits, but attributed it entirely to
my bearing the title of an Heiress of
Carlsheim and Sargans.”—</p>

<p class='c018'>—“Oh! lady,” exclaimed Herman
with all that impetuous warmth which
is usual in young warriors, and which
frequently borders on imprudence and
rudeness; “how much are you mistaken!
the title, which you have mentioned,
has no charms for me; besides,
you cannot be unconscious, that only
in consequence of my Uncle’s positive
command did I tender my services to a
daughter of Count Donat.”—</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>Could any human being have spoken
with more contempt and insolence?
From that moment I really began to
abhor the very sight of the youthful
Count of Werdenberg, though the
Bishop redoubled his exertions to influence
me in his favour. At length
finding me deaf to all his insinuations,
and that I persisted on all occasions in
avoiding his nephew, he plainly declared
his resolution of making me his niece,
whether my father should consent or
not; since the gift of my hand would
make young Herman lord of all those
extensive domains, which are generally
known by the name of the Twelve
Cantons.</p>

<p class='c018'>In reply, I declared my father’s intention
of making me take the veil;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>I also mentioned, that my sister being
older than myself had much stronger
claims than mine to the paternal inheritance;
but above all I dwelt upon
Herman’s behaviour to me, which became
more insulting with every succeeding
day. The Bishop treated the
two first objections very lightly, declaring,
that the mild and bashful Amalberga
seemed designed by nature for
a Nun, and that her embracing a religious
life, would leave me sole heiress
to my father’s possessions: but when I
declared my full persuasion, that I was
the object of his nephew’s aversion, the
Bishop gave way to an involuntary fit of
laughter.</p>

<p class='c018'>—“The youth is an ideot!” exclaimed
he. “Lady Emmeline, I protest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>to you, that in the very first moment of
beholding you his heart was made your
own, and he spoke of your charms with
rapture, as long as he was ignorant of
your name: in truth, his passion was
so evident, that it was this alone, which
suggested to me the idea of making
him happy by bestowing you upon him.
But no sooner was he informed, that his
adored Emmeline was the daughter of
that Count Donat, whose cruelty and
licentiousness have made him an object
of abhorrence throughout Helvetia, than
he changed his intentions, and swore
to extinguish in his breast every spark
of affection for one, who from her
birth and mode of education could not
possibly be worthy of the love of a man
of honour. The youth spoke much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>about the dissolute manners of Sargans,
about libertine associates, and unprincipled
courtezans, to whom the care of
your youth had been committed: nay,
(to conceal nothing from you) he even
found fault with your amiable gaiety of
character, which he called by the harsh
name of levity; and which (according
to him) showed him but too plainly
what your husband must expect, fascinating
as are the outward charms, with
which you have been so liberally endowed
by nature.”—</p>

<p class='c018'>Such, Urania, were the Bishop’s
words; but how shall I explain to you
the effect, which they produced upon
my mind! at the outset of this conversation,
the Uncle’s unjust and interested
views had increased my resentment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>against the nephew; and I was prepared
to express my disapprobation of both
in the strongest terms, when this last
speech gave a sudden turn to my
thoughts, and rendered it impossible
for me to utter a syllable more respecting
the business, which was then in deliberation.</p>

<p class='c018'>—“Herman’s heart once was mine!”—Such
was the sentence, which now
occupied my whole mind.—“His heart
once was mine,” I repeated to myself,
as soon as I was alone; “was mine,
before he knew my name and expectations!
and it is on this name and these
expectations, that his whole aversion is
now grounded!”—“the licentious manners
of Sargans.”—“My education
committed to unprincipled courtezans.”—“Oh!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>that is true, too true; but yet
Herman, does the mariner, who gains
the land amidst the fury of winds and
waves, deserve less praise, than he whom
favouring gales have wafted into the
haven? and is it just, that Amalberga
and Emmeline should be objects of
contempt and abhorrence, because even
in the very bosom of vice, surrounded
by a thousand snares, a thousand dangers,
they never yet wandered for a moment
from the paths of virtue?—but it seems,
my levity shows but too plainly, what
my husband may expect from me! oh!
Herman, that was cruel, was unjust!
it’s true, nature gave me a light heart
and a fondness for amusement, which
(having but just escaped from my paternal
prison) perhaps I may have sometimes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>suffered to carry me too far; but was
this a reason sufficient for condemning
me? alas! perhaps these very spirits,
with which you now reproach me as a
crime, are but a precious gift of Providence
to enable me to bear with fortitude
the weight of future woes!”—</p>

<p class='c018'>These reflections cost me many tears,
and I hastened to communicate their
cause to Amabel and my sister. With
their assistance, I soon discovered that
it was absolutely necessary to quit the
Bishop’s court without loss of time.
Amalberga was not less anxious to
avoid the Count of Torrenburg, than I
was to quit the unjust Herman for ever.
Its true, her gentle manners, her quiet
and retired turn of mind had saved her
from that prejudice against a child of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>Count Donat’s, which my gaiety had
excited against me in the bosom of
the Bishop’s nephew; but still her
union with the man of her choice was
equally impracticable, though on a different
account.</p>

<p class='c018'>The Count of Torrenburg was already
betrothed to the youthful Helen of
Homburg, whom I formerly mentioned
in such advantageous terms. He had
never seen her; of course she was
totally indifferent to him, while what
he felt for Amalberga.... Yet how
was it possible for the noble Eginhart
to break his knightly word? and even
had he been resolved to break it, how
was it possible for Amalberga to rob
the friend of her youth of an husband
so truly deserving, that scarcely could
Helvetia produce his equal?</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>Amalberga and Eginhart had never
exprest their mutual sentiments in
words: but it appeared to me, that
they had long understood each other
sufficiently to render any verbal explanation
needless.</p>

<p class='c018'>Our departure was determined. Our
next letters hinted to our father, that
he had but little reason to expect, that
the Bishop of Coira would assist his
views respecting us; and we soon received
an order to return to Sargans.
Amalberga and Eginhart made their
adieus rather by looks than words: as
for myself, I thought it unnecessary to
take any formal leave of Count Herman.
I felt sentiments in my heart towards
him, which I insisted upon terming
aversion, and grief that I had ever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>thought favourably of him; but Amabel
assured me, that I felt nothing of
the kind—she said, the whole was
nothing more than a misunderstanding,
which was greatly to be lamented; and
she vowed never to rest, till she had
justified me in the opinion of a man,
who by his endeavours to detach himself
from the woman whom he adored,
because he believed her unworthy of
his love, had proved sufficiently, how
totally his soul was devoted to the
cause of virtue.</p>

<p class='c018'>We had managed ill respecting our
hints to Count Donat. They excited
his suspicions against the Bishop of
Coira, and he insisted upon a full explanation.
This it was impossible to give,
without betraying all our own secrets;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>and the embarrassment, with which we
answered our father’s questions, drew
down a considerable share of his suspicions
upon ourselves.</p>

<p class='c018'>We had soon the grief to witness the
renewal of hostilities between Count
Donat and the Bishop, and to accuse
ourselves of having furnished the occasion.
At the same time we were
watched with the utmost strictness, and
on the pretence of suspecting us of
carrying on together some secret intercourse,
(though with whom was not
mentioned) we were separated. I had
always been in a slight degree a greater
favourite with Count Donat than my
unfortunate sister, and my beloved
Amabel was suffered to remain with
me. Amalberga was confined alone in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>this chamber, which I at present inhabit,
and ordered to resolve upon taking that
step, which she had formerly been forbidden
to think of; and which now was
only insisted upon, because it was fancied,
that she discovered some symptoms of
unwillingness.</p>

<p class='c018'>A day was already fixed, when Amalberga
was to take the veil in the
Convent of St. Roswitha. She discovered
more repugnance to this measure
with every succeeding day, though for
what reason I know not. Her love for
the Count of Torrenburg was hopeless;
what then remained for her, except
a cloister? the Abbot of Curwald past
several hours daily in endeavouring to
persuade her to obey her father’s commands;
and the dislike, which I feel
myself towards this man, makes me
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>think it probable, that his interesting
himself in the business made her still
more unwilling to comply. Besides
this, she received a letter from Gertrude
Bernsdorf, which Amabel found means
of delivering secretly, and which probably
was not favourable to the Convent
of St. Roswitha. However, I
am still ignorant of its contents; since
though whenever I was permitted to
pass a few moments with my sister, she
endeavoured to find means of communicating
something to me which lay
upon her heart, so many spies surrounded
us, that the attempt was always made
in vain.</p>

<p class='c018'>I have already informed you, my
kind protectress, on the last time that
I saw my sister, how I threw myself at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>my father’s feet, and implored for
gentler treatment both for her and for
myself; how I entreated in vain to be
at least permitted to pass that one night
with her; and how I had the agony
of being informed the next morning
that she was torn from me, without the
least information being given as to
whither she had been conveyed, or the
least hope held out of our ever being
re-united.</p>

<p class='c018'>Since that time my situation has
become more painful in many respects.
My friend, my Amabel was compelled
to abandon me, because it became evident
that Count Donat thought her
handsome enough to be raised, or rather
to be degraded, to the rank of one of
his favourites. You know well, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>Amabel’s open nature never suspects
villainy or danger, except where their
existence is not to be mistaken; and
therefore you cannot doubt, that she
had good cause for her flight from
Sargans; her departure and my sister’s
disappearance, following each other so
closely, robbed me of even that little
share, which I possest in my father’s confidence.
It was evident, that I had assisted
Amabel’s escape, and from this
he argued, that I was equally culpable
respecting Amalberga’s. Would to
Heaven, that this charge were just!
willingly would I pay for the certainty
that my sister is safe, by suffering twice
as much as I do on Amabel’s account,
and which I carefully conceal from my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>friend, that the knowledge may not
pain her gentle heart.</p>

<p class='c018'>Oh! Urania, you may chide as you
will, but can I <i>love</i> such a father?
think, that to him alone I owe the loss
of my sister and my friend; think too,
that his misdeeds were the sole cause,
which robbed me of the heart of the
man, on whom my whole earthly happiness
depended! Herman hated and
despised me only for being the Count
of Carlsheim’s daughter; now (as I
hear) he is the suitor of another maiden;
and all those hopes, with which Amabel
so fondly used to flatter me, of one day
regaining his good opinion, are lost, and
lost for ever.</p>

<p class='c018'>I am at length determined to take
the veil; fool that I was, for having
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>delayed to take it long ago! how easily
might I have remained in your convent at
any one of those times, when I privately
contrived to visit you! who would have
thought of looking for me there? or if
found, who would have been able to force
me from the protection of the powerful
Domina of Zurich?</p>

<p class='c018'>Alas! these reflections come too late!
I dare not quit my chamber, unless accompanied
by watchful guards; and no
one is suffered to visit me, except my
attendants and the odious Abbot of
Cloister-Curwald. He is the only
person, who combats my resolution of
obeying my father, and shutting myself
up for ever in the Convent of St. Roswitha.
I could almost fancy, that he
acts thus, because he knows me disposed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>to do exactly the contrary of every
thing, that he advises. In general these
dignified ecclesiastics are much more
inclined to speak in favour of religious
seclusion than against it.</p>

<p class='c018'>Yet whatever may be his design, it is
certain that I <i>shall</i> take the veil, or
rather that I <i>must</i> take it. My father’s
unaccountable determination of burying
his acknowledged heiresses in a cloister,
is decided and immoveable. I understand,
that weary of his riotous mode
of life and of the dominion of unprincipled
wantons, he meditates a second
marriage, and that he has selected one
of the fairest and most virtuous among
the Helvetian ladies to enjoy the happiness
and honour of enlivening days,
embittered by age, infirmities, and
remorse.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>Oh! pardon me, dear Urania, for
expressing myself with such bitterness
when writing of one, who with all his
faults is still my <i>father</i>! my unfortunate
situation, and the weakness of human
nature must plead my excuse for what
I have said above: neither did I mention
Count Donat’s future intentions for the
purpose of exasperating you against
him, but of interesting you in the cause
of the innocent girl, on whom my father
has fixed his choice. In truth, I need
but mention the name of her, whom
every engine of force and cunning will
be employed to bring into his power, to
induce you to exert yourself in defeating
his schemes: she is no other than
... Helen of Homburg! she is the
daughter of your friend and pupil,
Minna; she is the grand-child of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>companion of your sorrows, Edith of
Mayenfield! she is the betrothed bride
of the noble Torrenburg! oh! hasten,
if it be possible, to prevent the misery
of her, who in the days of my childhood
through her instructions and example
purchased for herself the strongest
claims on my gratitude! for myself, I
ask nothing but your blessing to assist
me in that profession, which I shall
shortly embrace irrevocably, without
bestowing one other lingering thought
on all the pleasures, which I leave behind
me in the world, and of which I have
now taken my farewell for ever!</p>

  <h3 class='c016'><i>Amabel to Emmeline.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Oh! lady, that you were but with
us! your sufferings in your father’s
Castle, and your melancholy resolution
of taking the veil would soon be effaced
from your thoughts completely! Great-ones
of the earth, do ye possess even
one of those many unconstrained and innocent
pleasures, which daily fall to the
lot of us, your inferiors? then only do you
enjoy the rights of Nature, (to which we,
the favourites of that kind mother, have
no better claim than yourselves) when
you throw aside your fetters, and dare
to act like the noble-minded Peregrine
of Landenberg. He, though the representative
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>of our feudal lord the powerful
Emperor, esteems us as not beneath
himself, and lives with us, as were he
one of the same humble station.</p>

<p class='c018'>Last Sunday ... never shall I forget
that glorious day! when the first beams
of the sun were discovered rising from
behind the hills of snow, and began to
tinge the lake with crimson, all the
young maidens of our quarter were
already assembled on the green meadow
before my father’s house—(you
know, that Henric Melthal is universally
respected, on account both of his
age and his wisdom.)—We were to
proceed to the neighbouring church in
solemn procession, and as Henric’s
daughter the right of heading the company
was mine: but I resigned my place
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>favour of a stranger damsel, who has
lately arrived at our village, and who
(however exalted may be her proper
rank) has become so well acquainted
with its disadvantages, that she has
been induced to resign it, and seek
comfort and oblivion for past sorrows
in the bosom of rural tranquillity.
Dear lady, could you but see this unknown
maiden.... She has adopted
our simple dress, and her peasant’s habit
makes it as difficult to with-hold admiration
from her, as to discover her: I
mean to say, that it alters her appearance
so much, that whoever had known
her in more costly apparel, would scarcely
recognize her in her present garb. I
saw her for the first time so drest on
this occasion; she has of late been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>resident in the Convent of Engelberg,
and.... But I am running on, forgetful
that I meant to describe to you the
festivities of last Sunday.</p>

<p class='c018'>As we moved on under the guidance
of our elected queen, our white robes
and unbound ringlets fluttered loose
in the morning-air, whose freshness
stained our cheeks with a deeper red,
and even spread a slight tinge over the
lovely pale face of our Conductress. It
was Easter-day; with songs, pious and
joyful such as suited the occasion, we
reached the Lake, where a croud of
painted boats waited to waft us to the
opposite shore, on which the grey
spires of the Convent-church were discernable;
and thither was our pilgrimage
directed.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>Long ago, a Convent was established
here respecting which there are still
many traditions current; but now
nothing of it remains but a heap of
ruins. The church however is still in
perfect preservation. It is never opened,
except on Easter-day: and as the Friars
hold this place in abhorrence as having
been the scene of many monastic crimes
and of Heavenly vengeance, it has ever
been found difficult to persuade any of
them to officiate within these deserted
walls. On these occasions, therefore,
the short service is frequently performed
merely under the superintendance of
the two elders of our village. The
service consists of nothing more than
the expansion and humiliation of the
heart before the Almighty for a few
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>minutes in adoring silence, and a solemn
hymn chaunted by the whole united
congregation, the words and melody of
which are equally simple to the ear and
affecting to the heart.</p>

<p class='c018'>Walter Forest and Werner Bernsdorf,
as the two eldest, opened the holy doors
for us, and we descended a few steps into
the chilling aisle of the church: they
commended us girls, for having shown
our impatience to pay our service to
Heaven by arriving the first. Soon
after the matrons made their appearance,
conducted by Gertrude Bernsdorf;
oh! with what joy did this
venerable woman, the counterpart of
her former mistress and friend Urania,
receive our conductress, the lovely
stranger! I mean, how pleased she was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>to see, that we girls were sensible of our
duties, and were arranged in the church
before her arrival.</p>

<p class='c018'>While we sank on our knees, and
silently offered up our gratitude to
Heaven, the men arrived.—I was still
kneeling by the side of our conductress
(our hearts were full; much had we to
return thanks for on that day) when
the solemn hymn began around us, and
compelled us to change our attitude.
The chorus of a thousand voices, whose
united melody made the vaulted pavement
tremble beneath our feet, informed
us, that the assembly had increased
greatly during our prayers. We hastily
drew back, for all eyes were fixed upon
us; but alas! I found it impossible to
withdraw my attention from the objects
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>which surrounded us, and restore my
heart entirely to that devotion, from
which the commencement of the hymn
had rouzed me.</p>

<p class='c018'>Alas! dear lady, your poor Amabel,
who past so grave a censure on the sudden
inclination conceived by yourself
and your sister for two knights, with
whose merits you were well acquainted;
that very Amabel has been still more
weak and hasty in her choice! it was a
man who stole my thoughts from
Heaven, and who made it difficult for
me to withdraw my eyes from his
countenance. In truth, it was scarcely
possible not to look at him now and then;
for he was placed exactly opposite, and
forgetting the motive which had brought
us together, he seemed to make me
the only object of his contemplation.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>It was now, Emmeline, that I envied
you one of the privileges of your rank;
I mean, your veil which we simple country-girls,
who love to look unimpeded at
the Almighty’s lovely world, and who
have no reason to conceal our countenances,
consider in general as an unnecessary
piece of dress. For the first time I
wished for a veil at once to conceal my
confusion, and to restore the man (who
continued to gaze on me with fixt
glances), to that devotion, which he
seemed to have lost.—However, he soon
recovered himself; but as for me, I still
felt during the remainder of the service
that kind of uneasiness, of which I have
so often heard others speak, and which
I have so often treated with derision.</p>

<p class='c018'>Well! say, that it be love, which has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>excited such emotions in my bosom,
why should I grieve? the path of the
humble children of the soil is not so
rough and uneven, as that of the mighty-ones;
the inclinations of the one are
not so subject to difficulties, as those of
the other; our inclinations and acknowledgements
are embarrassed by no superfluous
considerations of decorum and
etiquette; and unless the eyes of my
unknown friend have deceived me, I
am far from indifferent to him, and we
may hope for mutual happiness.</p>

<p class='c018'>Yet you will smile, when I describe to
you the person, of whom I speak. The
youthful Amabel has given her heart
to no stripling: the noble-looking exalted
man, with his heroic mien and
with that look of true Helvetian frankness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>which attracts the observer’s confidence
so irresistibly, is already in the
Autumn of life; and yet....</p>

<p class='c018'>But what am I doing? you cannot
suppose, that this transient feeling can
affect my heart seriously?—Oh! no,
no! everything is forgotten, or <i>must</i> be
forgotten, and it shall be done without
a single tear. The object of my attention
disappeared immediately after the
service, nor have I seen him since.
Perhaps, the whole business was a
fabrication of my fancy, for the fair
stranger, who stood next to me, cannot
recollect to have observed such a person.—But
then she was so entirely absorbed
in her devotions, that she did not even
remark, that Peregrine of Landenberg
never removed his eyes from her during
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>the whole ceremony; and when the
procession set forward on our return,
he followed her with looks that were
by no means equivocal: at least this is
asserted by several of my village-companions.</p>

<p class='c018'>Emmeline, how happy would it make
me, should such a heart as Landenberg’s
be bestowed on your ... I would say,
on my fair and unhappy friend. She
loves without hope; and Peregrine of
Landenberg, very handsome, very good,
and very powerful, is in every respect
calculated to make her happy. The
persons, whom the good emperor sends
among us as his deputies, are not inferior
in power to princes, and in birth are
as illustrious as Count Donat; and
Peregrine is so mild, so pious, so noble!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>in truth, the condescending manner in
which he treats all who are subject to
his authority, and the little distinction
which he makes between his station
and ours, have won me to his interests
completely.</p>

<p class='c018'>You will chide me for writing on no
other subject than love; but liberty,
health, and the contemplation of the
beauties of nature are the best nourishers
of that sweetest of all feelings! and be
comforted, dear lady; for you too shall
one day bless the hour, when your heart
first learnt to love. Let but this fair
stranger be once the bride of Peregrine
of Landenberg, and we shall soon find
means of rescuing you from your captivity:
then shall Herman of Werdenberg
(in whose union with the Damsel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>of Eschenbach there is not one syllable
of truth, and to whom I am certain you
are still as dear, as before he knew
your name) be compelled to do justice
to your excellence, and every trace of
misunderstanding shall for ever be cleared
away.</p>

<p class='c018'>The word “misunderstanding” reminds
me, that the day whose beginning
I have described to you, did not conclude
quite so well as was expected.
While the youths and maidens under
the care of some of our matrons past
the evening with songs and dances,
there arose some little discord among the
men. I mentioned to you in a former
letter the prejudices of some of them,
among whom I am sorry to count my
father. The Lord of Landenberg had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>prepared a splendid feast at the Castle;
but our elders thought proper to decline
partaking of it, and Landenberg was
obliged to consent instead to become a
guest at their rustic table in the valley.
Peregrine showed us this mark of condescension
with a good grace. Unluckily
during the entertainment there arrived
the emperor’s lieutenant of the next
Province, by name Gessler; and with
him came the Abbot of St. Gall, one of
the most abandoned characters existing.
These began to reproach our worthy governor
for his complaisance, and to treat
our elders with contempt; till the indignation
of the latter was excited, and they
gave the scoffers such answers, as they
deserved. The worst treated however
was the Abbot, who thought proper to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>defend Gessler’s conduct without having
either eloquence or common sense in
his discourse, nor indeed even breath
sufficient to utter it. Upon this several
of our young men (my brother Arnold
was one of the foremost) interrupted
him by singing in chorus the ballad
called “Bishop Ulric of Constance;”<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c020'><sup>[2]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>and at the end of every stanza they
introduced an extempore chorus applying
the ballad to the present Abbot.
This at length offended him so much,
that he left the place almost distracted
with passion; but Gessler thought
proper to remain behind, and is still
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>a guest at the Castle, from which many
of our wise-ones augur no good.—Farewell,
dear lady, and Heaven’s blessing
be with you.</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f2'>
<p class='c021'><span class='label'><a href='#r2'>2</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>About the middle of the 10th Century, Bishop
Ulric of Constance bequeathed “a very large hogshead
of good old wine” to the Convent of St. Gall,
on condition that the Monks should themselves be
at the trouble of bringing it home. Unluckily,
the waggon broke not far from the Convent,
and the hogshead fell into a deep pit: it was
recovered with great difficulty, and conveyed
home in triumph; where in remembrance of this
event a great feast was held, at which the
Monks, wearied with their exertions in its rescue,
did not spare the Bishop’s bequest. About
midnight (when all were buried in sleep, overcome
by fatigue and the strength of liquor) a
fire broke out in the Convent, and consumed it,
the Monks however escaped with their lives;
and the Abbot is said to have fallen on his knees
and thanked Heaven for its mercies, on hearing
that though the Convent was destroyed, he had
saved his strong-box, and the remainder of the
Bishop’s hogshead.—This probably furnished
the subject of the satirical ballad, mentioned
above.</p>

  <h3 class='c016'><i>Emmeline to Amabel.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Difficult as it was, I have accomplished
my painful confession to Urania,
and I feel my heart relieved; I also
made another important discovery to
her, but alas! without effect. It related
to Count Donat’s views upon the youthful
Helen of Homburg. As was expected,
her parents rejected his suit,
and it was not concealed from him, that
she was already betrothed to Eginhart
of Torrenburg. My father’s spies
brought him intelligence, that on Easter-Monday
Helen was to be conducted to
her bridegroom’s Castle; and Count
Donat chose his time so well, that it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>was almost impossible for his unfortunate
victim to escape him. He set
forward suddenly with the greatest part
of his soldiery; and this morning I
heard with horror, that Helen has fallen
into his hands! she has been carried by
him to the Castle of Upper Halbstein,
where he is determined to make her his
wife either by fair means or violence,
before her friends have time to effect
her rescue. My heart bleeds for the
poor Helen!</p>

<p class='c018'>I have already received orders to
prepare for my departure to the Convent;
it is thought desirable, that as
soon as the nuptial festivities are over,
I should no longer make the Castle of
Sargans my residence, Count Donat
supposing that my presence would be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>disagreeable to his new bride. Alas!
dear Helen, my presence <i>disagreeable</i> to
you? though I could not relieve you
from the weight of your cruel destiny,
surely the society of the friend of your
childhood, of a companion in sorrow,
would enable you to bear them with
greater fortitude.</p>

<p class='c018'>Methinks, Amabel, it seems to me
now more difficult to resolve on entering
a Convent.  Heaven knows, I
wished not, that Helen should be so
unfortunate as to become my father’s
wife; I spared no pains to rescue her
from this impending danger; yet if
in spite of my efforts she should be
compelled to become the Countess of
Carlsheim and Sargans, might not that
event produce the most desirable consequences?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>might not her virtue and
charms work a blessed change in
Donat’s nature? might I not in her
society and under her protection again
look forward with pleasure to living in
that world, which had once such charms
for me, but which of late I have considered
as an object of such disgust?
oh! what blessed effects might the
presence of such a mistress produce
throughout the domains of Sargans!</p>

<h3 class='c016'><i>In Continuation.</i></h3>
<p class='c017'>Where shall I look for help! how
shall I find some means of changing my
father’s determination respecting me?
This Convent.... Oh! Amabel, call me
not capricious, for I have now good
reasons to dread and shun that Convent.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>I have been warned, warned by some
supernatural being, not to take the step
prescribed to me by my father: and
shall I be disobedient to the voice of
Heaven?——Hear, what has happened
to me! I went this morning to walk
with my usual guards for a few minutes
on the battlements. I left my chamber-door
locked. Yet on my return I
found a slip of parchment fastened on
my tapestry frame, containing these
words:</p>

<p class='c018'>—“Fly from Sargans! destruction
awaits you at the Convent.”—</p>

<p class='c018'>I had scarcely time to conceal this
writing, (whose import, while I read it,
had made my blood run cold) before
the Abbot of Cloister-Curwald entered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>the room: I have already mentioned,
that he pays me a daily visit.</p>

<p class='c018'>The impression made upon my mind
by what I had just read, for some time
prevented me from attending to his
conversation: I believed, that in this
late occurrence I had received a confirmation
of that delightful idea, that
there exist guardian Angels, who at
times condescend to snatch poor mortals
from destruction; and my heart, already
half estranged from the Convent
by the hopes which I grounded on the
exertions of my amiable step-mother,
began to search for additional reasons,
why I should decline taking the veil,
once so much the object of my desires.
On a sudden something which fell from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>the Abbot in discourse, caught my attention;
and I now first discovered, that
the conversation which he had been addressing
to me, agreed entirely with the
warning of my guardian Angel. I drew
back in astonishment! its true, he had
before frequently exprest his disapprobation
of the Convent; but he now
spoke with more energy than ever, and
advanced such strong arguments, as
could only have failed of their effect,
because advanced by <i>him</i>.</p>

<p class='c018'>It immediately struck me, that the
mysterious warning was an artifice of
this man, who by means of that cunning
(which is universally ascribed to him)
had managed to obtain entrance privately
into my chamber; and who now,
by his taking this artful method to give
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>his arguments the greater weight with
me, became more than ever an object
of suspicion. Under this impression, I
threw the writing towards him with
contempt; and asked him—“whether
he knew, whose hand had written the
warning, which agreed so wonderfully
with his discourse?”—</p>

<p class='c018'>I was prepared to hear him deny
positively any knowledge of the parchment,
and pour out a long declamation
to prove, that it must have come straight
from Heaven: how was I astonished,
when on the contrary I saw the most
lively surprize and indignation exprest
upon his countenance. With a stammering
tongue he asked me, how I
came by the writing; and before I could
answer, he hastily enquired, whether I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>was sure, that my chamber-door had
been fastened, and whether I knew
anything of a private entrance? to these
questions I made no reply; I wished
to <i>obtain</i> information, not to <i>impart</i> it.</p>

<p class='c018'>With every moment he became more
uneasy. He examined the windows,
tried all the locks, stamped upon various
parts of the flooring, and then resumed
his seat opposite to me, and for some
time appeared to be lost in thought.</p>

<p class='c018'>After a long silence—“and so then”
I began, “the worthy Abbot Luprian
denies, that this writing came from him,
and that it was intended to give my
mind that impression, which his arguments
were unable to produce?”—</p>

<p class='c018'>—“And even suppose,” he resumed
after a considerable pause, “suppose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>that I should confess your suspicion to
be well-founded; would you therefore
accuse me either of treachery, or of
views inimical to your interests? well
then, lady; since the attempt to deceive
you would be vain, I own, that these
characters were traced by me. Take
the advice, which they give you; take
mine with it, and fly from Sargans!”—</p>

<p class='c018'>—“Fly, say you? my Lord Abbot,
this is the first time, that I ever heard
that word from your lips!”—</p>

<p class='c018'>—“Yes, lady, I repeat it! fly from
the insolence of your young step-mother,
from the tyranny of your unfeeling
father!”—</p>

<p class='c018'>—“And whither should I fly?”—</p>

<p class='c018'>—“To the Convent.”—</p>

<p class='c018'>—“What? of St. Roswitha?”—</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>—“Oh! no, no, no! any where,
but thither! fly to Zurich, to the protection
of your adopted mother, of the
venerable Countess of Carlsheim.”—</p>

<p class='c018'>Sweet as his words sounded, I knew
too well the impracticability of this
advice, to indulge the idea for a moment.
It was plain, that he was only trifling
with me; I turned from the hypocritical
Friar with contempt, and requested
his absence.</p>

<p class='c018'>Amabel, you already know, what
disgraceful reports are circulated respecting
this man; reports, of whose
justice his conduct towards myself has
left me no doubt! the modesty of Innocence
is always ashamed to own, that
she has been made the object of an
improper attachment: I have therefore
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>hitherto avoided the confession, that
Luprian (whose religious vows forbid
his laying any claims to the indulgence
of honourable love) has been daring
enough to avow a passion for me! this
it is, which makes his advice so hateful
to me; and this it is, which makes me
so determined to watch every word
which falls from his lips, in order that I
may act exactly contrary.</p>

<p class='c018'>The neighbourhood of his monastery
would make me averse to entering the
Convent of St. Roswitha, did not his
endeavours to put me out of conceit
with it convince me, that my abode
there will lay obstacles in the way of his
designs: he naturally foresees, that I
shall be better guarded against his importunities
when protected by the good
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>Abbess and her pious train, than in this
Castle where there is no compassionate
being to listen to my entreaties and
complaints.</p>

<p class='c018'>Before he left me, the Miscreant again
mentioned the Convent of Zurich; he
again advised me to hasten thither, and
had the insolence to propose to be the
companion of my flight! you will not
therefore wonder, that I repeated my
commands to be left alone in a tone the
most peremptory—I was obeyed.</p>

<p class='c018'>I past a great part of the night in
melancholy reflections. It was late, when
I retired to bed; but after the adventure
of that evening not thinking myself
in safety, I took care to fasten every
window most carefully, and trebly
turned the key of every lock.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>I started from my slumbers in alarm:
methought, a cold hand had touched
me! I uttered a loud scream on perceiving,
that the gloom of my chamber
was dissipated by a glimmering light,
and that a tall figure was standing at
the foot of my bed. My first thought
was, “this is a new artifice of the
Abbot;” but there was something in
the appearance of this figure so singular,
that my earthly terrors gave place to
others of a much more awful nature.</p>

<p class='c018'>It was a tall pale man, his countenance
bearing the marks of extreme old
age, and wrapped in a monk’s habit.
The blue faint glare of a lamp in his
right hand gave so strange and frightful
an appearance to the deep cavities of his
cheeks and eyes, that I was certain of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>being in the presence of a Denizen of
the other world, and in terror I concealed
my face beneath the coverlet.</p>

<p class='c018'>The fearful vision stood long by my
bedside. It muttered much in a melancholy
and imploring voice; but the
bed-cloaths, in which my head was
enveloped, prevented my distinguishing
what was said, till I caught something
which sounded like “Amalberga:” that
beloved name brought me in some
measure to myself. After a few moments’
hesitation I ventured to lower the
coverlet, and to look up.</p>

<p class='c018'>—“What?” cried I; “com’st thou
to tell me, that Amalberga’s spirit stays
for me? speak, awful vision....”—</p>

<p class='c018'>It heard me not! it had left my bedside;
I still saw at the further extremity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>of my spacious chamber the glimmering
of the lamp; but in a moment afterwards
all disappeared.</p>

<p class='c018'>I consumed the remainder of the
night in examining, what could be the
meaning of this midnight visit? I put
together the few fragments of the
Spectre’s discourse, which had reached
my hearing; and at first I concluded,
that the Abbot (from some motive or
other, but from what I vainly strove to
form a guess) had falsely accused himself
of being the author of the mysterious
warning; and that the parchment and
the spectre, which had both been conveyed
into my apartment so unaccountably,
must needs have some connection.
However, more mature reflection left
me no doubt, that both the one and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>the other were artifices employed by the
detested Monk to betray me into his
power; and I resolved never again to
sleep in this suspicious room, which so
easily afforded entrance either to corporeal
villains or to immaterial apparitions.</p>

<p class='c018'>My resolution was taken, and I executed
it. The insolent house-keeper
was well pleased to hear, that I meant
to quit this handsome apartment with
its noble prospect over hill and dale,
and which she immediately appropriated
to her own use; while I was contented
to take hers in exchange. I have accordingly
established myself in a small
chamber in the Western Tower, where
the only attendant who is suffered to
approach me is an old house-maid, who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>has out lived two generations of the
family of Carlsheim. She is a kind-hearted
creature, and frequently endeavours
to beguile me from weeping
over my doubtful and gloomy prospects
by many a tale of events long past, and
which now only exist in her recollection.</p>

<p class='c018'>Part of what she has told me, I shall
now repeat, since it seems to have
some connection with my midnight
visitor. The old Bertha listened with
great attention, while I recounted what
had happened, and paused for some
time, before she made any observation.</p>

<p class='c018'>—“Lady,” said she, “it is clear to
me, that you are deceived in supposing,
that what you saw on that mysterious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>night was either the delusion of
a dream, or the artifice of some villain;
no, lady, no! as sure as you sit there,
you have been visited by the real spectre
of a dead man!</p>

<p class='c018'>“Long ago ... (Lord forgive me!
it is long indeed, since I came to live
in this Castle!) long ago was that very
apartment the bed-chamber of the good
Countess Urania, who (they say) is still
living in some Convent or other. Her
husband Count Ethelbert was a cruel
man, almost such another as my lord
your father, whom Heaven mend, I
pray it! well! the Monks of Cloister-Curwald
expelled their Abbot and the
good Prior Matthias, who took refuge
with the Countess; and by means of
a subterraneous passage she enabled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>them to escape. Unluckily Count Ethelbert
was among the number of their
enemies; in a passion he sent his wife
away from Sargans, and then descended
into the subterraneous chambers to
seek for the fugitives. An old servant
of Count Ethelbert’s assured me, that
his lord discovered two of them, and
brought them back to that very chamber,
where they were tortured in hopes
of making them confess some secret or
other, though what I know not. At
length they were put back into one of
the subterraneous dungeons, whose entrance
the Count caused to be walled
up, and there they were left to perish
with hunger. Ah! lady, lady! the
dead, if they choose it, could reveal
many a cruel act, of which we little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>dream! many of my fellow-servants,
when afterwards Ethelbert lost his
senses, could not comprehend much of
his ravings; alas! I comprehended
them well! I knew much that must
have prest heavy on his conscience, and
which now is known to few except myself.</p>

<p class='c018'>“After a time the bodies of the good
Monks were removed from the cavern,
because it was said, that their spirits
appeared in that chamber, and wept, and
wailed so piteously, that nobody could
sleep for the noise! yet they were not
allowed Christian burial, but were cast
into that ruined draw-well in the little
back-court, in which finally Ethelbert
himself lost his life, being thrown into
it by the Abbot Guiderius. So you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>see, lady, crimes ever meet with their
just punishment, while innocence often
is rewarded, and always is avenged;
which I mention for your own consolation.
But as I was saying, doubtless it
was the blessed spirit of one of these
good Friars, which appeared to you the
other night; and truly it is a pity, that
your fear prevented you from listening
to what he said, for I warrant you, he
had good cause for coming. However,
it is now too late; and methinks as
matters stand, you will do well to take
the only means of security now left you
as soon as possible and enter into the
holy sisterhood of St. Roswitha, where
you will be well taken care of, both in
body and soul.”—</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>Such was the discourse of my old
attendant, which in truth was not calculated
to abate the awful impression
made on me by this mysterious visit!
however, whether her explanation was
right or false, it is certain, that the advice
contained in the conclusion of her
speech was the best that could be given.
I have just received an order from my
father to hasten my departure, since in
a few days he means to bring home his
young bride, and will be displeased to
find me still at Sargans.</p>

<h3 class='c016'><i>In Continuation.</i></h3>
<p class='c017'>Then my father has renounced me,
and for ever! renounced me for Helen’s
sake, and as they tell me, at Helen’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>persuasion! oh! how much must she
be changed, if she knows and countenances
the severity, with which I am
treated. Then farewell my paternal
mansion, and welcome, ye holy walls!
yet why should I grieve to go? what do
I lose in the one? what have I to fear
in the other?</p>

<p class='c018'>And yet methinks, I do not feel
quite satisfied in seeking the Convent
of St. Roswitha. Oh! if it were but
possible to escape to Zurich, where
Urania.... But alas! this is impracticable.
A strong guard is appointed
to conduct me, not whither I wish to
go, but whither my father chuses me
to be carried.</p>

<p class='c018'>Farewell, ye gloomy walls, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>have witnessed so many of my tears!
farewell too, thou my good kind-hearted
Bertha! would I had known sooner,
that among the Castle’s inhabitants there
existed one such honest creature, whose
simple counsels would have frequently
stood me in much stead, and whose
maternal sympathy would have cheered
many a heavy, heavy hour!</p>

<p class='c018'>The moment for my departure is come;
every thing is prepared. The insolent
domestics of the Count of Carlsheim, and
his still more insolent paramours (<i>they</i> are
not banished for Helen’s sake!) laughed
even now, when they saw me weep,
while I embraced poor Bertha. From
my window I see the litter ready, and
near it stands Abbot Luprian with that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>inexplicable look, which he always wears,
when there is mischief in the wind. I
will not honour him even with a single
word! oh! were I but safe within the
holy walls of St. Roswitha! were I but
sure, that on the road no artifice will be
employed to betray me into the power
of this Miscreant! Bertha’s account
both of him and his predecessor Guiderius
have taught me thoroughly, how
much is to be apprehended from men
of his character.</p>

<p class='c018'>Farewell, farewell, my Amabel! Bertha
has undertaken to convey this letter to
you: write a few lines to inform my
adopted mother, whither I am gone.
I have not yet answered your last
letter; it was too gay, and too unimportant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>to require an immediate reply.
In the Convent I shall have
leisure enough to discuss it fully.—Again
farewell.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>
  <h3 class='c016'><i>Amabel to Emmeline.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c017'>I am anxious to receive your answer
to my last; yet I will not wait for its
arrival, before I continue the narrative
of rural events: my heart is too full,
and I reproach myself much for having
wrapt my meaning in such mystery,
when I last wrote to you. Shame upon
me, for having trifled with your good
heart, and made myself a cruel sport
of throwing out hints to awaken your
curiosity, when I had it in my power
to make you happy by communicating
the most agreeable intelligence. Yet
surely you must have guest my meaning;
your heart will long ago have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>resolved your every doubt on the subject.
No sooner shall you have asked
yourself the question.—“Why does
Amabel write all these trifling particulars
to me? What have <i>I</i> to do
with the stranger, of whom she
talks so much? what concern is it of
mine, whether Landenberg loves her,
and what influence can her becoming
the bride of the emperor’s lieutenant have
upon <i>my</i> fortunes?”—no sooner shall
you have asked yourself these questions,
than a voice within shall whisper the
name of Amalberga; and the letter
which I now write, will give you the
assurance, that the voice spoke true.</p>

<p class='c018'>Yes, dear lady; your sister is now
an inhabitant of this Valley; she has
hitherto been sheltered in the neighbouring
Convent of Engelberg, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>she only quitted on hearing, that the
festivities, which are at present celebrating
in honour of liberty, would give
her an opportunity of embracing her
friends, the venerable Gertrude and
your Amabel. She earnestly desired to
discover to them her situation, and
more particularly wished to discourse
with me, from whom she hoped to
obtain the latest intelligence of her
beloved sister.</p>

<p class='c018'>I am quite vain of the friendship,
with which I am honoured by the illustrious
stranger, who meets here with
universal admiration. Yet in spite of
the preference, which she shows me
above the rest of my companions, (whom
she also condescends to call her own,)
still I am not her confidante. You
know, that she is naturally reserved:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>what was the cause of her sudden repugnance
to taking the veil, which had
once been the object of her wishes; why
she fled from Sargans; what induced
her to remain so long concealed at
Engelberg; all these points are still
unknown to me. Gertrude probably is
better informed: probably too the
packet, which your sister sends with
this, contains an explanation of all these
mysteries; I flatter myself you will with
your usual goodness impart so much of
the packet’s contents, as will satisfy your
Amabel’s curiosity.</p>

<p class='c018'>In hopes of inducing you to comply
with this request, I will not delay to
communicate to you all my own little
secrets; though I fear your interest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>about your beloved Amalberga and your
impatience to examine her letter, will
leave you but little concern to bestow
on the affairs of the humble Amabel.</p>

<p class='c018'>Know then ... that I am a bride;
yes, the bride of a man, whom I love
with my whole soul—and yet he is not
the person, who made such an impression
on my silly heart during the
Easter-service.</p>

<p class='c018'>Fool that I was! I cast my eyes on the
noblest among all the sons of Helvetia,
and thought, that he was just good
enough for the simple Amabel Melthal!
Has the name of William Tell never
struck your hearing? Helvetia boasts no
citizen more virtuous, no patriot more
zealous, no seaman more expert, no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>husbandman more industrious, no counsellor
more prudent, no warrior more
brave!</p>

<p class='c018'>And this very man was it, this identical
William Tell (who into the bargain
has long been married, and has several
children) who because he happened to
throw a few accidental glances on the
weakest and vainest of our country-damsels,
made her conclude forsooth that the
man’s heart was hers, and that he
desired nothing better than to possess
her heart in return.</p>

<p class='c018'>I should be a thousand times more
ashamed of my folly, had there been no
cause at all for my falling into such a
mistake. In truth, William Tell’s eyes,
which put all my devotion so completely
to flight at church, were not fixed on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>me without some meaning; nor were
they entirely without that expression,
which I fancied them to contain. He
really was more struck with my appearance,
than with that of any of my companions;
it <i>was</i> affection, which made
him consider me with such earnestness;
and after making a few enquiries respecting
me, he did not disappoint my
expectations; he actually came, and demanded
me in marriage.—Only, he
did not demand me for himself. No;
it was for his half-brother Edmund
Bloomberg, who in a few days more
will become my husband.</p>

<p class='c018'>Ah! dear lady, I could say much on
this subject. Certainly, love and courtship
are very different things in <i>our</i>
station and in <i>yours</i>. The important
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>“yes” is drawn from <i>your</i> lips by the
authority of parents, by convenience, or
perhaps by a sort of preference, which
you dignify with the name of love;
but when <i>we</i> acknowledge the noblest
and the chastest of all human affections,
our feelings are exhilarating and pure
as the gales, which blow from our
mountains; we look boldly towards the
distant futurity, which love paints in
colours as much more beautiful than
the present, as the views from the
summit of yon lofty rocks are superior
to any thing to be discovered in the
Valley. But <i>you</i>...!</p>

<p class='c018'>Its true, my present engagement is the
disappointment of my first love; but
yet it is really <i>love</i>, which I feel for
Edmund. He was already no object
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>of indifference even on Easter evening,
when he was my partner in the dance:
I discovered in his countenance features,
which reminded me of the unknown,
and his discourse betrayed a thousand
traces of generosity and benevolence.
But when he declared himself to be the
brother of the brave William Tell;
when William came to make proposals
for me, and I blushed to recognize in
him the object of my admiration; when
he told me in words, which never could
have sounded so well in any other
mouth, that he selected me for his
sister with as much care and as much
affection, as he had formerly selected
another maiden for his wife; then did
my heart resign itself fully to his directions,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>and I withdrew my love from him
to bestow it upon the man, who will
soon call me by the name of Amabel
Bloomberg.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>
  <h3 class='c016'><i>Amalberga to Emmeline.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c017'>At length then the time is arrived,
when I am permitted to give you some
intelligence of your lamented sister, for
well I know, that my Emmeline must
have lamented for me much: my heart
would have assured me of this, even
had not Amabel informed me, how
many tears the ignorance of my fate
had cost you.</p>

<p class='c018'>Gentle, feeling soul, receive now the
narrative of my adventures, of my freedom,
of my happiness! at the same time
receive the assurance, that it depends on
your own pleasure entirely to become
as free and as happy as myself. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>means too are the easiest imaginable,
and (though unknown to us) have long
offered us the opportunity of escaping
from an abode, where we have experienced
nothing but sorrow and persecution.</p>

<p class='c018'>Yet be it remarked, that things had
never been carried to so insupportable
a pitch, till the period when I was compelled
to take that most hazardous
measure of flying secretly from my
father’s house. Observe then well, my
sister, what I am going to relate, since
I fear, you will ere long be placed in the
same dilemma, and find no other means
of escape, except that by which I profited.
Oh! how earnestly have I wished
to communicate that means to you;
but I could find no security for a letter’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>reaching you, till Amabel informed
me, that she had a secret and certain
channel of communication with the interior
of Sargans.</p>

<p class='c018'>You cannot have forgotten, how full
was my heart of grief and affection,
when we quitted the Bishop’s court;
and that we both had soon ample reason
to repent our having laid our hearts
open to a man so stern and violent as
our father. Fortunately, our most precious
secret was still in our possession;
our attachments, both so unprosperous,
had not escaped our lips, or we should
undoubtedly have met with treatment
still more severe: yet what could well be
<i>more</i> severe than to be separated from
you, my sister, and confined for ever
within the gloomy walls of a convent?</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>These ideas were not to be endured.
You know, how dear you are to me,
and how much it would have cost me
to tear myself from one, whom I should
have missed at every moment of my
life. You know too, that it was easier
for <i>you</i> to reconcile yourself to exchanging
the unjust Herman for the veil,
than for me, on whose heart impressions
naturally engrave themselves more
deeply; besides I possest the melancholy
but sweet recollection, that Eginhart
of Torrenburg parted from me with
sentiments like my own, and was only
prevented from avowing them by the
solemn promise which he had given,
and by the chains of knightly honour.
Oh! Emmeline, it is much easier to
sacrifice a rejected heart to Heaven, than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>one whose affection is returned, even
though that affection be unfortunate.</p>

<p class='c018'>The very thought of a convent was
hateful to me; even had it been the
Convent of Zurich, to have entered it
would still have been misery; since my
heart yet cherished worldly hopes, which
even under the most gloomy circumstances
never fail to accompany that love
which is mutual. But now came the
moment, when the Sanctuary of St.
Roswitha (to whose service I was destined)
appeared to me of all others the
most odious; and I was firmly resolved
to endure every possible misery, rather
than suffer myself to be immured in the
dwelling-house of hypocrisy and corruption.</p>

<p class='c018'>My acquaintance with Abbot Luprian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>and with others the most distinguished
among the Monks of Cloister-Curwald,
had long ago eradicated
from my mind that respect, which
is generally entertained for the members
of religious communities. Still,
female prejudices made me restrict
my censure to the one sex; and I
fondly flattered myself, that vice could
never have insinuated itself into the
habitations of the brides of Heaven.
Methought, it was to the chaste and
pious daughters of the church, that
Virtue had fled for refuge; and I ever
united with the name of a Nun, the
highest idea of human purity, of intense
devotion, and of unsullied truth.</p>

<p class='c018'>Conceive then my disappointment,
when I was convinced beyond the power
of doubting, that the Convent of St. Roswitha
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>was the most licentious temple,
that ever was yet raised to unhallowed
pleasure!</p>

<p class='c018'>You are well aware, what sort of reputation
the Monks, who in latter times
have been Abbots of Cloister-Curwald,
have left behind them. <i>They</i> were the
founders of this Convent; knowing
this, you may well guess at the nature
of the institution. The endowments of
this house are immense: the indulgences,
with which they have been gratified
by the Holy Father of Rome, are as
numerous, as its inhabitants could themselves
desire. Nothing can be more
beautiful and picturesque than the Convent’s
situation, nothing more convenient
than the regulation of its interior.
As to the garments of the Nuns....
Yet that is a subject, upon which I will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>not trust myself to dwell. That excellent
friend (whose name for fear of
consequences I will not confide to paper,
but which you will easily guess) whose
letter warned me of the abyss into which
I was so near falling, inclosed a sketch
of the dress usually worn by the sisters
of St. Roswitha. To convince you of
the impropriety of their customs, I need
only mention, that these wretched women
refuse to make to Heaven the trifling
sacrifice of their ringlets, which hitherto
every Nun was expected to cut away
on the day of her reception. It is true,
when they are in the choir, or engaged
in a solemn procession, or, when at any
time the publicity of their appearance
makes it necessary to play the hypocrites,
the holy veil conceals their hair
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>curled with care and decked with
worldly ornaments; but the veil is but
seldom worn except on such public
occasions. Besides, would you believe
it, Emmeline? they wear shoes with
high heels and long-pointed toes fastened
up by silver chains; things which to
wear, would be reckoned both a sin
and a disgrace even for us worldly
damsels! judge from their dress what
must be their morals, and spare me the
pain of a description more circumstantial.</p>

<p class='c018'>The uneasiness, which my knowledge
of these particulars (contained in that
letter which you privately conveyed to
my hands) excited in my bosom, was
raised to the highest pitch by the discovery,
that Abbot Luprian was induced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>to influence my father to fix his choice
on this Convent for my future abode,
because he had views respecting me
the most improper; views, which he
thought could not fail of success, were
I once inclosed within the walls of St.
Roswitha, where (let him dissemble as
he pleases) to my certain knowledge he
is omnipotent.</p>

<p class='c018'>Here was a discovery! oh! my Emmeline,
how anxiously did I long to
communicate to you this information so
important to us both! I wished, that
you should be made aware of everything,
which could ever be in the
least detrimental to you; though from
your having always been my father’s
favourite, I concluded, that he would
not insist on your taking the veil so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>peremptorily, as was the case with his
rejected Amalberga!</p>

<p class='c018'>You must have remarked, that whenever
we were suffered to pass a few
moments together, a secret trembled
upon my lips, which I was only prevented
from revealing by the vigilance of our
jailors. I frequently resolved to disclose
everything to my father: I thought,
that he could not have been so unnatural,
so inhuman, as consciously to drive
his daughter into the jaws of perdition;
the Abbot and his accomplices would
have been unmasked, and myself rescued
from the dreadful Convent. But alas!
whenever I attempted to address him,
that dread of him, which we both of us
imbibed with our mother’s milk, overpowered
me, and I sank at his feet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>unable to pronounce a syllable.—Besides,
I had no proof of the guilt of the
Nuns of St. Roswitha except the letter
of my friend, who had always been
the object of his peculiar aversion, and
whose interference would have drawn
down upon her his anger and revenge.</p>

<p class='c018'>You know her well, that excellent
courageous woman; yet while she ever
exprest before us the utmost abhorrence
of the Convent of St. Roswitha, never
could she prevail on herself to sully her
lips and our ears by declaring the true
grounds of her aversion. At length
my extreme danger made her resolve
to sacrifice her delicacy, and she sent
me that intelligence in writing, which
she had never dared to reveal in speech.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>It was not the anger of my father,
which she had alone to apprehend on
this occasion; it was also the Abbot’s
power, who (if publicly accused) she
knew well, would be supported by the
Pope and the whole monastic community
of Helvetia. You are not now to
learn, how closely all Monks unite, when
one of their order is attacked by laymen.</p>

<p class='c018'>I knew not what to do; the day
drew near, which was to decide my
fate; the most painful distress preyed
upon my mind, and slumber seldom
visited my pillow. It was in one of
these uneasy sleepless nights, that I
heard a low murmuring sound at the
wainscot of my chamber. I listened;
at intervals the sound was repeated; I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>thought, that it was but the gnawing of
vermin, and I again reposed my head
on my pillow, when on a sudden I
heard a loud crash. The flames of the
night-torches streamed towards me, as
if impelled by a strong current of air;
I was struck by a piercing chillness,
which seemed to breathe from the
habitations of the dead, and before I
had time to collect my thoughts, I felt
myself encircled by two arms.</p>

<p class='c018'>In this situation, not to be in some
degree alarmed was impossible; yet
I had of late been so much accustomed
to terror, that this fresh trial did not
overpower my senses. I was aware,
that the arms, which had seized me, were
those of a female; and I soon recovered
resolution sufficient to examine the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>person, by whom I was thus unexpectedly
visited. I beheld with rapture
the dear friend, who had already warned
me; and with her was an old Monk in
the habit of Cloister-Curwald, whose
appearance had something in it so extraordinary,
that I doubt much if he
had approached me alone, whether I
should have received him with as much
fortitude, as I now did, when I saw him
accompanied by my excellent protectress.
It was indeed the consideration,
what terror might have been excited
by his visiting me by himself, which
had induced my friend to become his
companion.</p>

<p class='c018'>Oh! how can I sufficiently express
my gratitude to that dear woman for
the unwearied care, with which she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>watched over me. It was not enough
to have put me on my guard: she saw,
that I needed more to be done, and she
hastened to do it.</p>

<p class='c018'>Deep in the bosom of the hill which
rises to the north-west of Sargans, there
exists a small society of pious Hermits.
Their community is indebted for its
origin to a deposed Abbot of Curwald,
who, accompanied by five partners in
the same calamity, found shelter and
tranquillity in this unknown solitude.
The excellent Urania was their preserver.
Two of their companions who lost
their way while following them through
the subterraneous caverns, which they
traversed in their flight from persecution
either fell into the hands of their
pursuers, or must have perished accidentally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>by some miserable death; since
no tidings of them could ever be obtained.
The rest reached the place of
refuge in safety, and commenced a
tranquil and holy life in the wilderness,
which their industry soon converted
into a terrestrial paradise. Here they
long existed unknown to any one.
Some travellers, whom chance conducted
to their abode, were struck by
the air of innocence and happiness
which prevailed around them, and consented
to fill up the chasms left in their
society by the loss of their two unfortunate
brethren, and by the death of
the eldest of the fugitives named Matthias,
which shortly followed. The
three, who first offered themselves were
accepted; but the founder’s rules having
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>restricted the number of Hermits to six,
the others were compelled to withdraw
their request.</p>

<p class='c018'>Yet ever as death gradually removed
those, whom Urania had rescued, the
will of Heaven still conducted to them
some new associate; so that it almost
seemed, as if the society was kept complete
by a kind of miracle. Of those
who belonged to the original institution,
only <i>one</i> now remained in existence.</p>

<p class='c018'>Four years before her paying me this
midnight visit, had my protectress accidentally
been bewildered among the
mountains, and found her way to these
holy Hermits, who received her kindly,
and made her acquainted with the origin
and constitution of their order. These
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>circumstances were already known in
part to my friend, who had shared
with Urania in the good deed of saving
the persecuted Monks from destruction.
She declared her name to them, and
promised them eternal secrecy on the
one hand, as they did eternal friendship
to her on the other. The banished
Abbot and two of his companions were
at that time still alive; and looking on
the power of once more thanking one
of their preservers on this side of the
grave as a signal and most unexpected
blessing of Providence, they earnestly
entreated her to make frequent visits
to their solitude, and enjoy with them
a fore-taste of that tranquil happiness,
which awaits the blessed in another
world.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>She gladly accepted the invitation,
and (except to her husband, on whose
discretion she could depend) mentioned
to no one the existence of that Hermitage,
whither friendship and reverence
attracted her steps so willingly
and so often. The pious men became
the confidants of her most secret
designs; and I was too dear to her, for
her not to mention my name to them
and the difficulties in which I was involved.
This proved the means of my
preservation. The principal Hermit,
the only one of the six fugitives now
existing, remembered well the subterraneous
passage, by which he had fled
from destruction; and it was resolved,
that this passage should now furnish me
also with the means of escape; that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>Count Ethelbert had walled up the
entrance to the Castle was no obstacle
to this scheme: the three youngest of
the Brotherhood provided themselves
with proper tools; and their labours
were carried on with so much effect,
that I now saw myself under the protection
of my friend, and the road to
escape open before me.</p>

<p class='c018'>One only reflection embittered my
flight: oh! my Emmeline, how gladly
would I have made <i>you</i> the partner of
it! surely, some indistinct suspicion of
what was to happen must have floated before
your mind, and made you entreat
my father with such extreme earnestness
to be permitted to pass only that one
night in my apartment.</p>

<p class='c018'>Your prayer was refused, and my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>wish to rescue you rendered fruitless.
The day was breaking; expedition was
necessary. My friend too comforted
me by the assurance, that your situation
was not so immediately dangerous as
mine, and that at all events your escape
could be effected by the same passage,
should such a measure be hereafter
found adviseable.</p>

<p class='c018'>While we within the chamber were
busily engaged in arranging my flight,
the assisting Monks had been employed
on the outside in repairing the broken
wall and the wainscot, through which
was the passage to my room; and they
had performed their task so dexterously,
that though to enter it from without
was still easy, it was almost impossible
for persons unacquainted with the mechanism
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>to discover from within any
door leading out of the apartment.
Nothing however can be more simple
than this secret. On the south-west
side of our chamber, there runs a sort
of frame of carved ornaments round a
picture of the “Flight from Egypt.”—Count
the seventh pomegranate from
the bottom, and using some little strength
to force it back, you will possess the
key of the whole mystery. A slight
push will make the pannel recede;
a broad staircase of five-and-twenty
steps will then present itself, and if you
keep always to the right, you cannot
possibly miss your way. Yet the passage
is long, and fatigue or anxiety, lest
you <i>should</i> have mistaken the road, may
give you much disquietude, should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>you traverse the caverns without a guide
to comfort and sustain you. I advise
you therefore only to escape alone,
should you be in some most urgent
danger. The good Hermit has promised
also to watch over your safety;
he will keep a spy continually in the
Castle, who can inform him of all that
happens to you; and (should he find it
unavoidable for you to take so desperate
a step as the quitting your father’s protection)
then lest his unexpected appearance
should seriously alarm you, he will
prepare you for flight by a written
warning, and afterwards assist you to
carry his warning into effect.</p>

<p class='c018'>Yet in spite of these assurances, I
could not resolve on parting from you,
my beloved girl, without many a tear.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>I still loitered, wishing that I could at
least leave some token behind me to
convince you, that I was in safety, and
thus spare you the anxiety, which doubtless
my disappearance must have cost
you. But my deliverers insisted, that
any such measure was too pregnant
with danger to be adopted, and at length
I was compelled to obey and follow
them.</p>

<p class='c018'>I will not describe to you what I
suffered during my pilgrimage through
the long and gloomy passages, nor my
satisfaction at finding myself at length
safe in the dwelling of the holy Anchorets.
Oh! what can surpass the sentiment of
liberty, and the consciousness of being
surrounded by none but those, who are
virtuous and humane! how different,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>my Emmeline, from our feelings in the
Castle of Sargans! there we met at
every turning with nothing but present
sorrow and anxiety for the future;
with nothing but hypocrisy, perfidy,
the cruel necessity of concealing our
real sentiments from every eye, and
above all the terrific toil of wandering
along a slippery path, where we dreaded
with every moment to lose our footing,
and to be plunged into the same gulph
with those abandoned creatures, whom
we saw endeavouring to drag us down
with them to perdition.</p>

<p class='c018'>When we quitted the Hermitage, Gertrude
conducted me into these vallies.
She was well-known to the Nuns of
Engelberg, and easily obtained a refuge
for me in their Convent; and so happy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>did I feel myself among these pious
women, that had it not been for <i>one</i>
consideration, I should have become a
member of their sisterhood.</p>

<p class='c018'>Can you not guess that one?—Alas!
that even impossibility should be unable
to vanquish the power of love. Could
I but once accustom myself to unite inseparably
the name of Eginhart of Torrenburg
with that of the happy Helen, I
should soon succeed in convincing myself,
that to take the veil was now the
only option left me.</p>

<p class='c018'>Gertrude wrote me word, that the
Abbot of Curwald’s suspicions respecting
my flight having fallen upon her,
his secret persecution had compelled
her to repair to Stein; where her husband
was occupied in constructing a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>house suited to the improved state of
his income, and which displayed the
good taste imbibed by him in his youthful
Italian travels. I was delighted to
have my friend so near me; and my
joy was increased, when I heard, that the
great meeting of the Helvetians on the
borders of the Lake of Thun would not
only furnish me with an opportunity of
seeing Gertrude and her husband, but
of embracing our mutually-beloved companion,
Amabel Melthal.</p>

<p class='c018'>Oh! what a blessed day was that of
our reunion! as I lay before the altar,
the most fervent prayers of gratitude
for my own escape, of entreaty for
yours, flowed from my heart, and left
me no leisure for observing the little
incidents which occurred during the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>service. The lively Amabel assures me,
that the eyes of the most distinguished
person present, of no less a man than
the Emperor’s Vice-gerent, were fixed
upon me from beginning to the end.
It was her prejudice in my favour, which
made her imagine this: there was
nothing, which could have led him to
distinguish me from the other village-maidens,
not even my dress; since not
only prudence but my natural taste has
induced me to adopt the usual garments
of the Helvetian country-lasses. Still
Amabel asserts, that there was a look of
distinction and nobility about me, which
attracted the eyes of the Lord of Landenberg;
and it is certain, that during
the whole of that evening he seldom
suffered himself to be away from me
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>for a single moment. Unluckily, his
attentions by no means flattered me; and
should I find Amabel’s suspicions likely
to be verified, I shall lose no time in
regaining the Convent of Engelberg.</p>

<p class='c018'>Any further explanation of what has
happened to me I shall reserve for our
meeting, which I now look forward to
with impatience. The search after me
seems to have been given up; and
Gertrude has at length permitted me to
disclose the secret, by which you may
join us at your pleasure. In spite of the
good Monk’s sermons, and of advice
more savouring of prudery than sound
sense, I charge you, dear Emmeline, <i>not</i>
to wait for things being carried to the
greatest extremities, before you make
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>use of the secret disclosed in this letter—and
yet to fly from a father’s house
without the most absolute necessity....
Alas! I know not what to <i>advise</i>;
I know only, what I <i>wish</i>.</p>

<p class='c018'>Yes! earnestly, most earnestly do I
wish to see you once more my companion,
not only for <i>your</i> sake, but for
my own. I dare not entirely confide
myself to our good Amabel: how is
it possible with her talents, that she
should be so partial to persons so unworthy
of her esteem; and how can
she be so blind as to repose such imprudent
confidence in those, whose
intentions are (at the best) extremely
to be suspected? yet ’tis her own
open guileless nature, which misguides
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>her respecting others; and unfortunately,
those others know but too
well, how to turn her weakness to
their own advantage.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>
  <h3 class='c016'><i>Amabel to Emmeline.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c017'>How long a period has elapsed, since
a letter from your hand reached the
inhabitants of these vallies! is it not
wrong to mingle so much anxiety with
the pleasures of your friend, or is
Bloomberg’s wife less dear to you, than
the play-fellow of your childhood, Melthal’s
daughter?</p>

<p class='c018'>I really begin to suspect, that there
is something in wedlock which frightens
all unmarried persons away from us
sober matrons. Since my wedding,
Amalberga seems less at her ease with
me, though I spare no pains to make
my house agreeable to her. Peregrine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>of Landenberg, the good-hearted unassuming
Landenberg, frequently honours
me with his visits; and it quite vexes
me, that he should so seldom find my
society made delightful by the presence
of the “lovely stranger,” for in our
valley Amalberga is known by no other
name.</p>

<p class='c018'>I confess the Lord-lieutenant (whose
gentleness of manners prevents his rank
from being felt as a constraint) would
be a more welcome guest to me, did
not his seneschal Wolfenrad follow him
every where like his shadow. Yet I
know not why I should have taken such
a dislike to this man; he is sensible, and
nothing can be more proper than his
behaviour; and yet somehow or other,
I cannot endure his countenance. However,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>I try to conquer this antipathy,
since he is in high favour with my
husband, and Peregrine has commissioned
him to settle with me the best means
of enforcing his suit with Amalberga:
for you are to understand, that he has
avowed himself her suitor, and that in
express terms.</p>

<p class='c018'>For Heaven’s sake, dear Emmeline,
persuade your sister not to throw away
her happiness. Eginhart of Torrenburg
is now quite out of the question:
the whole country rings with the report
of the splendid balls and tournaments
which are shortly to be given, in
honour of his union with the youthful
Helen of Homburg.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>
  <h3 class='c016'><i>In Continuation.</i></h3>
</div>
<p class='c017'>Emmeline, what dreadful tidings
have reached us! it is said, that Helen
has been carried off by your father, and
compelled to espouse him; and that you
are already ordered to depart for the Convent
of St. Roswitha! Heavenly powers,
should these tidings be true!—What
can be done for you? what can I do?
And yet Amalberga assures me, that she
informed you of a means of escaping,
that could not fail.——Could I but consult
with your sister, or with Gertrude
Bernsdorf!—but even in these once
tranquil vallies there is but too much
uproar and disturbance carrying on.
Disputes have arisen between the Governor
and the elders of our people; in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>consequence of which, the most distinguished
of the south-western deputies
have hastily quitted these parts; Gertrude
and her husband have also left
us unexpectedly; and neither Landenberg’s
tears nor my entreaties could
prevent your sister from returning to
her Convent.</p>

<p class='c018'>In my anxiety to do something towards
your rescue from this impending
danger, I have conquered my prejudices
against Wolfenrad, and applied to
him for advice; for his patron the Lord
of Landenberg is too much occupied
with public affairs to permit his listening
to my difficulties, and my husband
declares himself incapable of advising my
proceedings in so delicate a business.</p>

<p class='c018'>Wolfenrad’s counsel is, that Edmund
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>should arm a body of his young companions,
hasten to Sargans, force you
from the guards who will be appointed
to escort you to that abominable Convent,
and then convey you hither or
else to Engelberg. I was in terror and
anxiety; this must plead for me, when
I confess, that my fears got the better of
my prudence, and that I have made
Landenberg and his Seneschal acquainted
with more respecting you and Amalberga,
than was by any means necessary.
And yet what harm was there in making
a confident of the man, who (I sincerely
hope) will one day conquer Amalberga’s
unjustifiable obstinacy, and give my
dear Emmeline a brother’s protection
and a sister’s name?—oh! let but this
one step be taken, and all your difficulties
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>will speedily be at end; Landenberg
is powerful; let but Landenberg once be
Amalberga’s husband, and she and you
will be both as happy, as your Amabel
would be now, did not anxiety upon
your account embitter her every moment.</p>

<h3 class='c016'><i>In Continuation.</i></h3>
<p class='c017'>Misfortunes follow each other so
close, that grief bewilders me! I know
not how to collect my thoughts sufficiently
to write down the number of
wounds, which have been inflicted on
my heart within these few days.—And
for whom should I write them down?
not for thee, sweet Emmeline, for it is
but too probable; that thou art in a
better world! not for thee, Amalberga,
for thou art gone, gone no one knows
whither! yet will I commit to paper
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>what has past, and what I feel, in hopes
that should the grave hide me without
my ever again embracing my friends
and sisters, they may see how much I
have suffered on their account, and may
do justice to the fond heart of their
lamenting Amabel. And that the grave
<i>will</i> hide me, and that soon.... Oh! is
it not most probable? all around me is
confusion, is uproar! all are furious,
though wherefore I know not: yet surely
the most pious and peaceable of all
people, that the earth holds, can never
be so blind to its own interests, to its
own happiness, as to rise in rebellion
against the Lieutenant of their imperial
patron, against the most gentle and
benevolent of created beings, against
Peregrine of Landenberg!</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>What have we to do with the evil
reports, which reach us from that unhappy
Province, where Gessler rules
and rages? we are secure under Landenberg’s
protection; we can even expect
from his generosity succour and compassion
for our less fortunate brethren.
To all of them, but above all to my
venerable father and to my brother’s
family, (who consider themselves as no
longer safe in the neighbourhood of
Gessler’s jurisdiction) has Landenberg
voluntarily offered an asylum among our
mountains, which (I trust) will still long
remain the abode of peace! I must lay
down my pen! my heart is too full at
present to admit of my writing intelligibly;
besides, I see Wolfenrad approaching,
who (now that my husband
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>has departed to see what can be effected
towards your preservation) is my only
comforter, and who doubtless comes to
tell me, what has been done on your
behalf, and whether anything remains
for me yet to do.</p>

<h3 class='c016'><i>In Continuation.</i></h3>
<p class='c017'>I am something more composed: there
are hopes, that my Emmeline may have
escaped from this dreadful scene! Wolfenrad
has promised to hasten in person
after my husband, and assist him in the
researches, which are making respecting
you: he engages also, should you be
found, to deliver this and my former
letters into your hands. Heavens! how
one may be deceived at first sight!
there was a time, when I could not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>endure this man, and now that all others
have forsaken me, he proves the most
active of my friends!</p>

<p class='c018'>There are many parts of my former
letters, which will appear to you mysterious;
I will now explain them. I
received on the same day your written
narrative of what had past in your
father’s Castle, and further tidings respecting
you, which overpowered me
with horror. Your letter, which you
left with Bertha, must have remained
in wrong hands for whole months
together; and the condition, in which
it at length reached me, has left me no
doubt, that its seal has been forced, and
its contents perused by more persons
than myself.</p>

<p class='c018'>Scarcely had I recovered from my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>alarm at finding, that you must have
set forward long since for St. Roswitha’s
Convent; scarcely had I received my
good kind husband’s promise, that he
would immediately set out and make
closer enquiries respecting you, when
the dreadful report reached me, that
flames had consumed that very Convent;
flames not kindled by chance or
the vengeance of offended Heaven, but
by sacrilegious cruel men! nor was the
sword less active than the conflagration;
it is said, that few have escaped
with life from this horrible outrage,
whose instigator’s name is still unknown
to us. Much too is said respecting the
secrets of this Convent, by no means to
the credit of its inmates; we have even
been assured, that the Abbot of Cloister-Curwald,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>and the chief part of his
brethren were involved in the Convent’s
destruction, though whether they came
there on the news of the danger, or were
found with these wretched Nuns at the
moment when their habitation was attacked,
I will not pretend to judge.
Every malicious speech, which relates
to the Convent in which (according to
all accounts) you must necessarily have
past two whole months, seems to plant
a fresh thorn in my bosom.</p>

<p class='c018'>Bewildered by these dreadful tidings,
I believe, that I must for a time have
lost my senses: for I suddenly found
myself at the gate of Amalberga’s sanctuary,
without being conscious how I
came there, or what was my object in
coming. Probably I wished to unburthen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>to her my full heart, and indulge
myself in bewailing with her our mutual
misfortune; but I could not hope to
obtain either assistance or advice from
her, whom the tidings which I had to
communicate must needs make, if possible,
still more wretched and more
helpless than myself.</p>

<p class='c018'>I rang the bell, and the Porteress
appeared. Conceive what I felt at hearing
from her, that that very morning
during matins a band of armed men
had rushed into the church, had
seized Amalberga, and had forcibly borne
her away. By whom this atrocious
outrage was committed, no one yet
knows: the people on hearing of it
broke into universal uproar, and raved
against this violation of the Sanctuary!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>now, all voices but mine unite in laying
the blame upon Landenberg; and to
prove the probability of his being the
offender in <i>this</i> instance, innumerable
deeds of infamy, said to have been
secretly committed by him, have been
alledged against him; some of them of a
nature, that makes even Gessler’s most
infernal actions appear but trifles. Alas!
is it possible, that I have been so grossly
deceived by the simplicity of my heart?—Even
Wolfenrad, the most faithful of
his vassals, does not venture to assert
positively, that he is innocent: but let
who may be guilty, that worthy man
has promised to assist us, and I hasten
to finish this letter, that I may commit
it to his care. Oh! should he be so
fortunate as to find you, hesitate not to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>confide in him, and follow him to these
vallies; alas! I can no longer call them
these <i>happy</i> vallies, for peace is banished,
and discord and confusion have usurped
her place. Its true, as yet open
hostilities have not taken place; but the
cry against Landenberg is loud, and the
public voice scruples not to compare
him to Gessler, the inhuman governor
of Uri.—“Freedom! freedom!”—is
now the word in every mouth; but it
sounds no longer so melodious, as when
it formed the burthen of our Sunday-songs!
it seems to me, as were it spoken
in the dying groans of those, who must
purchase with their blood the small
portion still left of this treasure!</p>

<p class='c018'>To complete my misery, my good
old father and my brother are arrived
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>at my cottage in a condition, that makes
my heart bleed. My father has been
cruelly mis-used by Gessler, and his
lands are confiscated; Arnold has been
obliged to fly, on account of having committed
the mighty crime of striking
the officer of justice, who seized our
father’s oxen, and then contemptuously
bade the poor old man yoke <i>himself</i> to
the plough in future, and do the office
of the beasts which he had lost.—Oh!
dear Emmeline, I sink beneath the
weight of griefs, which my Edmund’s
absence makes me feel doubly heavy.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>
  <h3 class='c016'><i>Amabel to Emmeline.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c017'>I hoped to derive some comfort from
the presence of my relations, but my
hope has proved vain. My father lies
ill and helpless on his bed from the
consequences of Gessler’s ill-usage; and
Arnold.... You will suppose, that I can
receive but little augmentation of my
tranquillity from this impetuous young
man, when you recollect, with how
much violence and passion he used to
watch over me in former times. If he surprised
a youth gazing on me with rather
too much earnestness though but for a
moment, that moment was sufficient to
make him almost frantic with resentment,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>and vow vengeance against the
offender; nay, he even dared to extend his
vigilance to yourself and Amalberga. Do
you recollect a particular evening, when
you had both privately stolen with me
to my father’s cottage in hopes of passing
a few gay and pleasant hours, which
seldom occurred at the Castle of Sargans?
it is as present to my recollection,
as had the scene past but yesterday!—it
chanced, that some stranger-knights,
who were going to a tournament at
the court of the Bishop of Coira, had
seen us on the road; as we were all
three arm in arm, they supposed us to
be of the same rank; they delayed their
journey, got themselves introduced into
our joyous circle, and proposed to us
to dance; but Arnold.... Ah! you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>cannot have forgotten, how sharply he
answered them; how bluntly he gave
them to understand, that their departure
was desirable; and how (as he
conducted us back to the Castle) he
made no scruple (without heeding your
rank) of reading you both a severe
lecture upon the necessity of reserve
towards strangers, and the propriety of
living retired under your paternal roof.</p>

<p class='c018'>Well! the part which he then thought
proper to play, he has now taken up afresh,
but with more warmth than ever.
One would think, he might find other
things to do now, than to watch his
sister’s conduct; but not the most
trifling of my actions passes unobserved
by him, and very few of them pass uncensured.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>He forgets, that it is solely
on your account, that I have any intercourse
with Wolfenrad; and that it is
absolutely necessary for an intercourse
to be kept up, as long as he journeys
backwards and forwards about
your affairs, and brings me tidings respecting
you, which hitherto (Heaven
be thanked!) have been favourable.
My brother insists upon it, that I ought
never to exchange a syllable with this
man; although he is much too old and
too ugly to be an object of danger or
suspicion, even were I not protected by
such good preservatives against the arts
of a seducer, as an heart full of love for
Edmund, and veins full of that blood,
whose every drop is true Helvetian!</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>What Arnold may <i>think</i>, I cannot
say; but I <i>know</i>, that love is never
mentioned in my conversations with
Wolfenrad. He is married as well as
myself, and at all events it would be
unwise to offend him just at present,
when he has the power of doing us so
much harm; for during Landenberg’s
absence he can act exactly as he pleases.</p>

<p class='c018'>However, I have given up the point.
Arnold has taken a cottage near me,
and as my own is solitary and unsafe
during Edmund’s absence, I have removed
to my brother’s, where I share
with my sister-in-law the office of nurse
to my poor sick father. Here there is
no chance of seeing Wolfenrad, for
there has lately been an open quarrel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>between him and Arnold, whose threshold
he has sworn never to cross again.
Yet I am impatient to find an opportunity
of conversing with him; for I
collect from some hints (which he has
occasionally thrown out, though there
was not time to explain himself) that
he has not only proofs of your having
escaped from the conflagration, but that
he has actually conveyed my letters to
your hands. As to Amalberga, he referred
me to a Nun at Engelberg, who
is better informed than himself; but he
said, that in what regarded you, dear
Emmeline, the intelligence, which he
had to communicate, could be given by
no one but himself, and was of a nature
too delicate to be conveyed through a
third person.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>I have told every thing to my sister-in-law,
who is my confidante: she disapproves
of her husband’s strictness,
and agrees with me, that I ought to take
the earliest opportunity of going to
Engelberg, and learning some news of
your sister. She cannot approve of my
having any intercourse with Wolfenrad
in defiance of my brother’s positive
commands; but she has kindly consented
to see him herself, and endeavour
to learn from him the good tidings
respecting you, which I am too anxious
to hear, to permit my waiting for
them with patience. Whatever may
be the consequence, I <i>must</i> be informed,
and that speedily, how and where you
are at present, and by what blessed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>means you escaped from the hands of
your persecutors, and from the fiery
death which menaced you in the Convent.</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
